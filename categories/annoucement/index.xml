My name is Sahil, and I’m running to be your First-Year rep at the CCSS! Having oranised and participated in various hackathons, seminars and workshops, I’ve concluded that the best way to grow as a professional in today’s tech scene is by developing soft skills; something that a classroom environment often fails to deliver. As a means to collectively work on our existing technical and interpersonal skills, I have planned various activities if I’m elected as your first year rep.</description></item><item><title>First Year Representative Platforms</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/first-year-rep-platforms-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/first-year-rep-platforms-2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Rabten Tsering's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/rabten/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/rabten/</guid><description>Hey fellow first years, my name is Rabten, Ragna on discord. As a first-year rep, I’m looking to connect with other first years and create a friendly environment in the discord and soon on campus. Schooling during a global pandemic leaves much to be desired, but I hope to make the best out of our situation and create an online and offline community that we can all thrive in! I would do this by (A) looking for more beginner-friendly events, as some people are learning comp sci for the first time (B) organize game nights for some quality social time and (C) create opportunities to interact with upper years because a little guidance is always useful!</description></item><item><title>Shirley Zhan's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/shirley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/shirley/</guid><description>Hello everyone, I’m Shirley.Z and I’m running for CCSS’s first-year rep! I’m going to make this really short since I know everyone’s really busy. I have a lot of experience working in leadership positions in various clubs and councils(can vouch as someone who’s joined 9+ extracurriculars overall in high school) so I think I’ll fit this position perfectly. On top of that, I also really love drawing and if I’m voted, I’ll be sure to bring some artistic and creative ideas to CCSS events.</description></item><item><title>Thushen Mohanarajah's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/thushen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/thushen/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s make this short and sweet.

Create an active discussion on how to network and explain how it helps you make friends, learn knowledge fast and helps you land an internship!</description></item><item><title>First Year Representative Nominations</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/first-year-rep-nominations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/first-year-rep-nominations/</guid><description>The Carleton Computer Science Society is looking for two first year CS students to join our Board of Directors as First Year Representatives for the academic year 2021-2022.

You may have heard some talk over the past few days about first year reps. But what is a first year rep, and what does it entail to hold one such position? For the CCSS, First Year Reps are the voice of the first-year students in computer science. They help advertise our events to new students, and they can run events and initiatives of their own as well. First Year Reps are members of the CCSS Board of Directors, and get to have a say on all important decisions.</description></item><item><title>VP WiCS Announcement</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2018-2019/2018-09-08-vp-wics-announcement/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2018-2019/2018-09-08-vp-wics-announcement/</guid><description>Over the past few months, the Board of Directors of the CCSS has been discussing the possibility of creating a new position to collaborate with the WiCS (Women in Computer Science) group on campus.
