My name is Sahil, and I’m running to be your First-Year rep at the CCSS!
Having oranised and participated in various hackathons, seminars and workshops, I’ve
concluded that the best way to grow as a professional in today’s tech scene is by developing
soft skills; something that a classroom environment often fails to deliver.
As a means to collectively work on our existing technical and interpersonal skills, I have
planned various activities if I’m elected as your first year rep.

As a first-year rep, I’m looking to connect with other first years and create a friendly environment in the discord and soon on campus. Schooling during a global pandemic leaves much to be desired, but I hope to make the best out of our situation and create an online and offline community that we can all thrive in! I would do this by (A) looking for more beginner-friendly events, as some people are learning comp sci for the first time (B) organize game nights for some quality social time and (C) create opportunities to interact with upper years because a little guidance is always useful!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shirley Zhan's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/shirley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/shirley/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello everyone, I’m Shirley.Z and I’m running for CCSS’s first-year rep! I’m going to make this really short since I know everyone’s really busy. I have a lot of experience working in leadership positions in various clubs and councils(can vouch as someone who’s joined 9+ extracurriculars overall in high school) so I think I’ll fit this position perfectly. On top of that, I also really love drawing and if I’m voted, I’ll be sure to bring some artistic and creative ideas to CCSS events. And on top of all that, I’m 100% a cat person.

I&amp;rsquo;m Thushen! In my past experiences working at RBC as an Innovation Developer, attending hackathons and running the Computer Science Club at my high school. I learned pure coding skills aren&amp;rsquo;t enough. Networking is one of the most important skills to create opportunities, to learn and grow as an individual. This is what I have planned as your first year-representative:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Create an active discussion on how to network and explain how it helps you make friends, learn knowledge fast and helps you land an internship!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Host more networking events!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Host beginner workshops in many tech-related categories such as Git, Socket.io and Android development.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Move more CCSS events to &lt;a href="https://www.gather.town/?utm_term=gather%20town&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Branded%20Search_Gather%20Town&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=search&amp;amp;utm_content=499147839023&amp;amp;hsa_acc=5772092952&amp;amp;hsa_cam=12358653067&amp;amp;hsa_grp=121764253590&amp;amp;hsa_ad=499147839023&amp;amp;hsa_src=g&amp;amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-981544684057&amp;amp;hsa_kw=gather%20town&amp;amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwtMCKBhDAARIsAG-2Eu9fmw4ThqtQhmJAl8YNSYalyedtwlDWCiwCB0bh_2XGeVOGq2YXU-AaAkWAEALw_wcB">Gather Town&lt;/a> to make a more interactive experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make some CCSS events in-person in the winter term as long as the School of Computer Science deems it is safe.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>What is Gather Town?

Similar to the Fall 2020 SCS Undergraduate Feedback &amp;amp; Suggestions Survey that was created for computer science students to share their experiences and opinions regarding online courses with the School of Computer Science (SCS) administration, staff, and faculty members (that report can be found &lt;a href="http://ccss.carleton.ca/community/news/blog/feedback-and-suggestions-survey/">here&lt;/a> and the password was sent to all B.C.S students in February 2021), a &lt;a href="http://ccss.carleton.ca/community/news/blog/winter-feedback-and-suggestions-survey/">Winter 2021 SCS Undergraduate Feedback &amp;amp; Suggestions Survey&lt;/a> was also created.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CCSS X SCS Feedback and Suggestions Survey</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2020-2021/2021-04-04-winter-feedback-survey/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2020-2021/2021-04-04-winter-feedback-survey/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/news/2020-2021/survey.jpg" alt="survey!">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we’re nearing the end of the Winter term, how was this term compared to the Fall term? Was it better, worse, or the same? What did you find challenging?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Carleton Computer Science Society (CCSS)&lt;/strong> wants to hear from you! It is important to us that students have their voices heard through channels that they can trust and are comfortable with. As the elected student representatives this school year, we have many opportunities to share student experiences and opinions with the School of Computer Science (SCS) and its faculty members, including teaching staff.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Board of Directors Election Results 2021-2022</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2020-2021/2021-03-30-election-results/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2020-2021/2021-03-30-election-results/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/news/2020-2021/vote.jpg" alt="election">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hello everyone! It is my great pleasure to be running for CCSS President once again. In my three years of experience on the CCSS Board of Directors, I have amassed a varied skillset and informed insight on the way the society operates. The society has undergone many changes and significant growth under my governance over the past year. I plan to continue this trajectory as your president for next year. If re-elected,I will 1) advocate to the School of Computer Science and the Faculty of Science for an increase in dedicated space on campus for CS students; 2) create more opportunities for our student body to get involved in the society&amp;rsquo;s activities (e.g. facilitating event collaboration with experienced students, reforming Carleton DevClub, increasing student-prof interaction); and 3) improve the quality of the society&amp;rsquo;s current services (e.g. establishing higher standards for event organization, increasing funding for lounge services, bettering communication to students through relevant social media). It&amp;rsquo;s time for the CCSS to fill its shoes as a society that represents all of Carleton University&amp;rsquo;s undergraduate CS students. So when you&amp;rsquo;re filling out your ballots, just remember: where there&amp;rsquo;s a Will, there&amp;rsquo;s a way! As always, I am open to any feedback you may have. Please contact me by email via &lt;a href="mailto:william.so@ccss.carleton.ca">william.so@ccss.carleton.ca&lt;/a> for questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding my candidacy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Year Representative 2019 Elections</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2019-2020/2019-09-23-first-year-rep-2019-elections/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2019-2020/2019-09-23-first-year-rep-2019-elections/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/news/2020-2021/vote.jpg" alt="election">&lt;/p>

&lt;img src='https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/first_year_reps/2019/ujan.jpg' />
&lt;p>Hi everyone! I’m an international student from India and I’m excited to be a part of Carleton University and the CCSS. So, a little bit about me.
I’m a huge soccer buff and an MCU fan (fight me, DC fan bois.) I love trivia and quizzing and just love fiddling around with the computer but also, making friends and meeting new people, in general. I would be honoured to be an FYR for the CCSS, and to be the voice of all the first-year students who are often looked over. I promise that I will listen to what everyone has to say and feed your opinions to the rest of the exec board if I’m chosen. I’ve previously assumed leadership roles in high school so I know the responsibilities that such a position demands. I have plenty of exciting plans for the CCSS in general but also to ensure fun participation for all the first years. So, do vote for me and I will not let you down. Cheers!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CCSS Election for 2019-2020</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2018-2019/2019-03-15-ccss-elections-platforms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2018-2019/2019-03-15-ccss-elections-platforms/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/news/2020-2021/vote.jpg" alt="election">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Throughout my academic career over the past two years at Carleton University, I have been heavily involved with the CCSS - as a First Year Representative last year, and as the current VP Social. In that time, I have gained many great experiences, and learned a lot about organizing student events and making important decisions with a team of people. However, I have also seen firsthand the pitfalls that can arise with the way our current administration operates, and I believe that it is time for me to address the prevalent issues that we face as your next CCSS President.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Changes to the Constitution</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2018-2019/2019-03-04-changes-to-the-constitution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2018-2019/2019-03-04-changes-to-the-constitution/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/news/2020-2021/vote.jpg" alt="election">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The notable changes are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The addition of a new elected position entitled &amp;ldquo;Director of Inclusion&amp;rdquo;, whose mandate is to promote and represent diversity initiatives within the society&lt;/li>
&lt;li>References to a new standing document entitled The Electoral Code, which establishes rules on how the CCSS general elections are to run each year&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Slight changes to formatting and wording to make the Constitution more readable, without altering the sense (except with the changes mentioned above)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

Each person may only give one nomination.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Year Rep Elections</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2018-2019/2018-09-06-first-year-rep-elections/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2018-2019/2018-09-06-first-year-rep-elections/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/news/2020-2021/vote.jpg" alt="election">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hey, first-years!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may have heard some talk over the past few days about first year reps. But what is a first year rep, and what does it entail to hold one such position? For the CCSS, First Year Reps are the voice of the first-year students in computer science. They help advertise our events to new students, and they can run events and initiatives of their own as well. First Year Reps are members of the CCSS Board of Directors, and get to have a say on all important decisions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VP WiCS Announcement</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2018-2019/2018-09-08-vp-wics-announcement/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2018-2019/2018-09-08-vp-wics-announcement/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/news/2020-2021/vote.jpg" alt="election">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past few months, the Board of Directors of the CCSS has been discussing the possibility of creating a new position to collaborate with the WiCS (Women in Computer Science) group on campus. We are pleased to announce that we will be welcoming a new position to the CCSS, VP WiCS!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CCSS hopes to place a bigger importance on diversity efforts in the following years to come. VP WiCS will be a dedicated a position on the Board of Directors that will lead these diversity efforts, ensuring the events and atmosphere of the computer science society is welcoming and inclusive. Many students have expressed interest in this initiative while we conducted surveys during Summer 2018. We hope that this change will connect CCSS and WiCS more closely so that the community is less divided. By making it a crucial part of the CCSS elections, we hope to stabilize the governance structure within WiCS to ensure the longevity of the group.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lab and Study Space Concerns</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2016-2017/2016-11-17-study-spaces/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2016-2017/2016-11-17-study-spaces/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/news/2020-2021/vote.jpg" alt="election">&lt;/p>
