It&amp;rsquo;s almost time for the Autumn of Rust üçÇü¶Ä! This is a (free) student-run course that I just taught over the summer, and I&amp;rsquo;m bringing it back for the fall semester!
I wanted to run this course since there are several concepts in the Rust language that we don&amp;rsquo;t (currently) learn in courses at Carleton. This includes a lot of topics in:

This gives Carleton students several projects to contribute to over the summer, which are designed to help other students. You can read more about the projects on this Notion document.
This blog post will introduce some of the students behind these projects. Any student can participate, and many are in different years of university. There are also many different skill sets in use, with development to the frontend of websites, backend web servers, and even some other tooling in the middle.</description></item></channel></rss>
