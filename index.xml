&lt;p>As Industry Initiatives Director, I will lay the foundation for long-term success by creating essential resources that future directors can build upon. This includes a comprehensive database to track company partnerships, a strategic playbook to guide outreach and relationship-building, and other key tools to streamline industry engagement. With these resources, we can secure stronger partnerships, increase funding for major events, and create lasting connections between students and industry leaders ensuring our society continues to thrive for years to come.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jacc's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/academics/jacc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/academics/jacc/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey everyone!

&lt;p>In my opinion, the website has room for additional resources for:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>How to study for and where to find study material for courses&lt;/strong> that are often challenging. Often, in some of the harder second-year courses students may feel a little stuck. Instead of waiting for study session events to run on their specific course, this would be a permanent resource to help them get back on track.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Getting and preparing for internships.&lt;/strong> One of the FAQs I see all the time is “How do I get my first internship?” or “How do I prepare for an Interview?” and while we do run events specifically addressing these questions, having a dedicated page to answer your questions when you need it is nothing but a bonus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>How to get involved in open-source.&lt;/strong> Other than all the amazing benefits of open-source projects they are also an amazing spot for people to get started with development experience as there is no barrier to entry; There is no time wasted wondering what project to do; And there is something to do for any skill level.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I would take the lead on getting these resources available to students, and with the help of volunteers looking for development experience, it would be well maintained as well as knowledge transferred to future years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nandita's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/academics/nandita/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/academics/nandita/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a computer science student, I know how challenging and rewarding our courses can be.

&lt;p>I know that social interaction plays a vital role in our academic success and well-being.

&lt;h3 id="what-is-research">What is research?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The goal of academic research is to add to the body of knowledge within a field. Generally speaking, research either aims to understand (e.g. “Are there biases in the outputs produced by large language models?) or to create (e.g. “Here is a new protocol for sending messages across the internet”). Depending on the specific field, this could involve running experiments or simulations, designing algorithms or processes, interviewing or observing participants in a study, and so on. There is also generally an expectation that the results be communicated in some way. Most commonly, this is done through a written report, a poster, or a presentation.

&lt;p>Over the past decade, Carleton’s Computer Science program has grown rapidly and our student population has tripled. However, funding for the initiatives that enhance your university experience, especially those tailored for computer science students, has not kept pace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, the Carleton Computer Science Society (CCSS) only receives $3,000 in consistent funding each year. With such limited financial support, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to maintain our services, especially large-scale events like hackathons and company networking nights that draw hundreds of participants.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COMP2804 Midterm Review</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2024-2025/2024-10-28-2804-study-session/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2024-2025/2024-10-28-2804-study-session/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Horror Game Session</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2024-2025/2024-10-24-horror-game-session/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2024-2025/2024-10-24-horror-game-session/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="link-to-downloading-game">Link to Downloading Game&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on all sides of education - as a computer science tutor, student, and school board trustee representing 27000 peers in Eastern Ontario. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a strong focus on making CS education more accessible, extensive, and enjoyable!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a first year rep, I&amp;rsquo;d hope to take advantage of my connections in the field to expand the current resources available to CCSS students - be it academic supports, or funds to create cool projects and plans to organize exciting events. One way I plan to do this is by strengthening connections between the CCSS and the rest of the campus as a whole, helping get our name out further while allowing us to take on bigger, better endeavours. I&amp;rsquo;d also try to connect us to external sources of funding (because who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like money) by collaborating with organizations who share similar values.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alex's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/alex/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/alex/</guid><description>&lt;p>YOUR SUCCESS is my priority, and I mean it.

&lt;p>As your first-year representative, I’ll ensure the voices of all first-year students feel heard while pushing to bridge gaps between all computer science students to foster a supportive, tight-knit community here at Carleton University.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While coding is commonly seen as a solitary task, I believe true strength lies in collaboration! First-year can be a very stressful and overwhelming experience for many, so I find it very important for CCSS to host various types of events to support students coming together and connecting with others. By organising a diverse range of events–from casual meetups to collaborative workshops–we can ensure that students can not only find support through their peers, but feel as though they belong amongst a community.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Muhammad's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/muhammad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/muhammad/</guid><description>&lt;p>The word limit is 500 I don&amp;rsquo;t need that let me keep it simple.

&lt;p>Being a first year student is crazy because more often than not we don&amp;rsquo;t really know what we&amp;rsquo;re getting ourselves into and if you are an international student like me we&amp;rsquo;re going in totally blind. As your rep I&amp;rsquo;m going to make sure that we know exactly what we&amp;rsquo;re doing, that&amp;rsquo;s important. On top of that I&amp;rsquo;m going to make sure that we get our recognition and have our impact on the board and the decisions that are made. I use the plural tense in these examples because this position will not be my position it will be OUR position.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Randiv's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/randiv/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/randiv/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/first_year_reps/2024/randiv.PNG" alt="Randiv">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I were elected as the First-Year Representative, my top priority would be to create a strong connection between first-year students and the CCSS. To guarantee that your voices are heard, I want to ensure all communication channels to the CCSS are clear and easily accessible. Staying informed about what the Society is hosting can sometimes feel overwhelming, so I focus on creating digestible updates, through social media, email, or even short video clips. By actively collecting your feedback, I can ensure that CCSS is doing what you want! Whether you have ideas for events, suggestions for improvement, or concerns that need addressing, there will always be open lines of communication through drop-in sessions and constructive feedback forms where you can share your thoughts directly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Laser Tag Night</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2024-2025/2024-09-14-woa-lasermaxx/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2024-2025/2024-09-14-woa-lasermaxx/</guid><description>&lt;p>Purchase a ticket for the event here: &lt;a href="https://carletoncss.myshopify.com/products/lasermaxx-ticket-september-14th-5pm-tax-included">LaserMaxx Tickets&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pink Lake Hike</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2024-2025/2024-09-14-woa-pink-lake-hike/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2024-2025/2024-09-14-woa-pink-lake-hike/</guid><description>&lt;p>We will meet at Pindigen Park and then take a shuttle to the Pink Lake hiking trail.

As your first-year representative, I have ran several events related to networking, and I look forward to boost my impact as the Director of Industry initiatives. As the first Director of Industry Initiatives, I will be expanding on the events I planned this year and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="resume-review">📝Resume Review📝&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This year, I organized the first resume roast at the beginning of the year where I invited a graduate student with FANG experience as well as two other reviewers with startup experience to come in as resume reviewers.
As the Director of Industry Initiatives, instead of having students as resume reviewers, I will be inviting recruiters and HR from tech companies to review your resumes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Benjamin's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2024-2025/academics/ben/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2024-2025/academics/ben/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey everyone! My name is Ben, and I’m currently in 2nd year. Having already had 1 year of experience as your Director of Academics, I believe that I can help contribute to your academic success. Computer science is a hard program to get through, but I want to make YOUR life easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some ideas I have to meet that goal:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Course-specific study groups&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a lot of courses that could benefit from organized group study, and over the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve helped run multiple study groups. Sometimes it really helps to have a place where everyone can come together and share their ideas in preparation for a test/assignment. This is something I plan on continuing throughout the academic year, and I would be open to organizing one as soon as there is enough demand.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Camerons' Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2024-2025/finance/cameron/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2024-2025/finance/cameron/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey everyone!

&lt;p>I believe in transparency and accountability when it comes to spending practices. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m committed to fostering more active discussions within our community about how we allocate our funds.

Despite numerous open IT positions, concerns loom over the impact on tech careers. The introduction of Generative AI, including tools like Copilot and DALLE2, has amplified the potential for substantial work automation, reshaping the industry&amp;rsquo;s landscape. Industry veteran Dave Thomas, drawing from five decades of experience, explores the implications of these disruptive changes in his talk. He shares insights on learning from past transformations, highlights key areas for individual and team investment, and provides a forward-looking perspective on the evolving dynamics of Tech and Tech Careers in the 202x.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resume Office Hours</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2023-2024/2024-01-08-resume-office-hours/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2023-2024/2024-01-08-resume-office-hours/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Horror Game Session</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2023-2024/2024-01-05-horror-game-session-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2023-2024/2024-01-05-horror-game-session-2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="link-to-downloading-game">Link to Downloading Game&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Hello! My name is John, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to be chatting a little about my experience with the Students as Partners Program.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-sapp">What is SaPP?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Students as Partners Program(SaPP for short) is a 1-2 term project, where you create/develop curriculum resources for a professor&amp;rsquo;s class. It can range from a website that shows how something is done to articles on what to focus on in a course. An example of something that could be but isn&amp;rsquo;t an SaPP project is DiscreteMath.ca, which was built to serve COMP2804 Students. The best part is, you get paid to create resources in SaPP. If you&amp;rsquo;re not thinking of going the academic route, then this is a great way to develop your industry skills.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COMP 1405 Final Study Session</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2023-2024/2023-12-17-comp-1405-final-study-session/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2023-2024/2023-12-17-comp-1405-final-study-session/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="slides">Slides&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>You can use any library to achieve this. If you&amp;rsquo;re unsure where to start, this &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@y.mehnati_49486/how-to-send-an-email-from-your-gmail-account-with-nodemailer-837bf09a7628">guide&lt;/a> demonstrates how to send emails using &lt;code>nodemailer&lt;/code> with the Gmail SMTP server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Timetable creation is handled in the Timetable Service (&lt;a href="https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/hack-the-tunnels-starter-2024/blob/main/service/src/services/Timetable.ts">service/src/services/Timetable.ts&lt;/a>) inside the &lt;code>createTimetable&lt;/code> method.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hello everyone!
My name is Aditya but my friends call me Jacc. I’m an international student from India and while I’m not currently in a stream, I’m considering minors in Law and Physics. You may know me as the owner of the “Carleton Class of ‘27” discord server. I have been running informational and social events for incoming first-year students over the summer. I have also been volunteering with the CCSS for the last few months to create a new resources section of the CCSS website.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Aidan's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2023-2024/aidan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2023-2024/aidan/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/first_year_reps/2023/aidan.jpg" alt="Aidan">&lt;/p>

If elected, I will advocate for 4 main initiatives:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>o More events like the industry mixer, for you to interact with potential employers and start building a professional network&lt;/p>
&lt;p>o Presentations from older students in co-op, where you can address questions and concerns regarding the co-op process&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hello everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m Aires. As the former president of my high school coding club, I sure do love coding. I&amp;rsquo;m from Toronto, so I knew no one when I first came here, but I like to spontaneously greet random people, so if you have no one to say hi to, I&amp;rsquo;ll say hi to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="partnering-with-other-cs-related-clubs">💻Partnering With Other CS-Related Clubs💻&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In most of our conversations with new people, the question of &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;What stream are you in?&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; usually pops up, and many have not decided yet. I will hold workshops with upper years to share their experience in different streams and partner with other more specific CS-related clubs to allow a better understanding of different programming fields.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jaime's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2023-2024/jaime/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2023-2024/jaime/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/first_year_reps/2023/jaime.jpg" alt="Jaime">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Alan Tsang is an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Science. He obtained his PhD at the University of Waterloo, and was a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the National University of Singapore. He conducts research in Multiagent Systems, which analyzes systems populated by multiple reasoning agents where the agents may be reasoning about each other. His focus is on the intersection between social networks and social choice. In particular, he is interested in how self-interested agents with bounded rationality interact with social choice mechanisms and each other, resulting in complex emergent behaviors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The CCSS x Battlesnake Tournament: Campus Tour Edition</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2022-2023/2023-03-03-battlesnake-campus-tour/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2022-2023/2023-03-03-battlesnake-campus-tour/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Speed Friending Friday</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2022-2023/2023-03-03-friday-speed-friending/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2022-2023/2023-03-03-friday-speed-friending/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Tech Talk Night</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2022-2023/2023-03-01-tech-talk-night/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2022-2023/2023-03-01-tech-talk-night/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recording: &lt;a href="https://carleton-ca.zoom.us/rec/play/suayv5n1yBGagwQip-yaCnqY84Nnoi8moV9sS-buLqZCjsI6oBLYF1heqiXwjHp95R-r2xB0aJnbv91A.VMlK8IJzDaK79Wb3?startTime=1677711826000#P4">Zoom&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CCSS General Election Platforms</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections-2023-2024/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections-2023-2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>The CCSS Elections for 2023-2024 have begun!

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s almost time for the Autumn of Rust 🍂🦀! This is a (free) student-run
course that I just taught over the summer, and I&amp;rsquo;m bringing it back for the fall
semester!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to run this course since there are several concepts in the Rust
language that we don&amp;rsquo;t (currently) learn in courses at Carleton. This includes a
lot of topics in:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>language safety (begone segfaults!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>concurrency (what if threading wasn&amp;rsquo;t scary? 👻)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>functional programming (&lt;code>iter().filter().map()&lt;/code>&amp;hellip;).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Hello! My name is Nicholas O’Neil. I was born in Ottawa and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my life in the area. I am a first-year Computer Science student. I am interested in the Game Development stream; however, I’m currently not in a stream as I would like to have some time to consider my options. Since discovering the CCSS, I have been enthusiastic about becoming involved, and I believe serving as the First Year Representative is the best way to do so!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Niraj's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2022-2023/niraj/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2022-2023/niraj/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/first_year_reps/2022/niraj.jpg" alt="Niraj">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the beginning stages of my programming career, I have experienced the difficulties that early programmers have gone through. Such as, finding the perfect tutorial, understanding online instructors or any programming classes. Using the knowledge of the struggles early programmers go through, I have decided to help first-year computer science students to succeed in university and also the future. Even though introduction to Computer Science 1 is supposed to start the basics of coding for inexperienced programmers, I can say that the professors don’t always start from the beginning, leaving some students clueless. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ryan's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2022-2023/ryan/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2022-2023/ryan/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/first_year_reps/2022/ryan.png" alt="Ryan">&lt;/p>

Carleton students several projects to contribute to over the summer, which are
designed to help other students. You can read more about the projects on &lt;a href="https://angelonfira.notion.site/CCSS-Dev-Projects-Summer-2022-d0284164d0ae4a4f8bbdd43783f4c09e">this

My name is Ben, and I’m currently in 1st year. Although I may not have much experience within the university, I believe that I can help contribute to your academic success. Computer science is a hard program to get through, but as Director of Academics, I want to make YOUR life easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some ideas I have to meet that goal:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Course-specific study groups&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a lot of courses that could benefit from organized group study. Sometimes it really helps to have a place where everyone can come together and share their ideas in preparation for a test/assignment. This is something I plan on continuing throughout the academic year, and I would be open to organizing one as soon as there is enough demand.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Byron's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2023-2024/social/byron/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2023-2024/social/byron/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi everyone!

My name is Sahil, and I’m running to be your First-Year rep at the CCSS!
Having oranised and participated in various hackathons, seminars and workshops, I’ve
concluded that the best way to grow as a professional in today’s tech scene is by developing
soft skills; something that a classroom environment often fails to deliver.
As a means to collectively work on our existing technical and interpersonal skills, I have
planned various activities if I’m elected as your first year rep.

As a first-year rep, I’m looking to connect with other first years and create a friendly environment in the discord and soon on campus. Schooling during a global pandemic leaves much to be desired, but I hope to make the best out of our situation and create an online and offline community that we can all thrive in! I would do this by (A) looking for more beginner-friendly events, as some people are learning comp sci for the first time (B) organize game nights for some quality social time and (C) create opportunities to interact with upper years because a little guidance is always useful!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shirley Zhan's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/shirley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/shirley/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello everyone, I’m Shirley.Z and I’m running for CCSS’s first-year rep! I’m going to make this really short since I know everyone’s really busy. I have a lot of experience working in leadership positions in various clubs and councils(can vouch as someone who’s joined 9+ extracurriculars overall in high school) so I think I’ll fit this position perfectly. On top of that, I also really love drawing and if I’m voted, I’ll be sure to bring some artistic and creative ideas to CCSS events. And on top of all that, I’m 100% a cat person.

I learned pure coding skills aren&amp;rsquo;t enough. Networking is one of the most important skills to create opportunities, to learn and grow as an individual. This is what I have planned as your first year-representative:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Create an active discussion on how to network and explain how it helps you make friends, learn knowledge fast and helps you land an internship!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Host more networking events!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Host beginner workshops in many tech-related categories such as Git, Socket.io and Android development.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Some natural and human-engineered processes exhibit patterns that suggest an underlying algorithm. For natural processes, this could be thought of as the biochemical processes dictated by genes or other natural forces. For human-engineered processes, such algorithms represent either memetic thought within a culture or the physical limitations and requirements for human use. This research has examined inferring the algorithms used by such processes from data observed over time. For example, taking a sequence of photos of a plant as it grows can be used to infer the algorithm used by the plant to grow.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clubs &amp; Societies Info Session</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-09-18-clubs-info-session/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-09-18-clubs-info-session/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>As &lt;a href="https://ccss.carleton.ca/about/team/">elected student representatives&lt;/a> of the Carleton Computer Science Society (CCSS), it is important that undergraduate computer science students under the School of Computer Science (SCS), studying at Carleton University, have their voices heard through channels that they can trust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to COVID-19, many students have expressed concerns regarding challenges in an online learning environment. Similar to the Fall 2020 SCS Undergraduate Feedback &amp;amp; Suggestions Survey that was created for computer science students to share their experiences and opinions regarding online courses with the School of Computer Science (SCS) administration, staff, and faculty members (that report can be found &lt;a href="http://ccss.carleton.ca/community/news/blog/feedback-and-suggestions-survey/">here&lt;/a> and the password was sent to all B.C.S students in February 2021), a &lt;a href="http://ccss.carleton.ca/community/news/blog/winter-feedback-and-suggestions-survey/">Winter 2021 SCS Undergraduate Feedback &amp;amp; Suggestions Survey&lt;/a> was also created.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speed Friending</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/social/2021-04-09-speed-friending/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/social/2021-04-09-speed-friending/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Open source software development is a methodology that has grown significantly in the last few years. Although the open source mindset has been around since the early days of operating system development, it has only become mainstream in the last decade due to advances in how we communicate and share code. Many companies are shifting towards tech stacks that are in part or are entirely open source. Open source developers are able to make careers off their work through sponsorship.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Landscape</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/academic/2021-03-10-blockchain-crypto-landscapes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/academic/2021-03-10-blockchain-crypto-landscapes/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="recording">Recording&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I’m Aaditya Chopra (or you could just call me Adi) and I’m running to be your Director of Social for this year’s board of directors!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m someone who’s really passionate about getting involved with the student body, as well as event planning and having some fun, while also connecting with other people! As such, I would love to bring that passion to the board of directors this year as we transition from this weird online/in-person phase.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amelie's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/academics/amelie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/academics/amelie/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello world! My name is Amelie Haefele and I&amp;rsquo;m going into my third year here at Carleton while currently living on residence. I promise to encourage the academic opportunities and learning of all students in Carleton’s Computer Science Society and any others who wish to join. With the move to online many, including myself have found it much harder to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
To combat this I plan to create online and in person events so everyone can choose which medium they prefer. 
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
To do this I will plan to have in person events(rules permitting) and livestream it using zoom and/or discord. Along with connecting chat to the speaker so they are able to answer questions and interact with students.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
To start this off I plan to create an in person meet and greet/study session on campus for those interested.
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So stay tuned for timing and more information. I hope to meet and interact with you all soon!
Thank you so much for reading,&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fahim's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/finance/fahim/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/finance/fahim/</guid><description>&lt;p>I would like to run for the Director of Finance because it&amp;rsquo;s a great opportunity for me to improve my current skills and give back to the computer science community. Ever since I came to Carleton I wanted to be as involved in the community as I could. Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;m well qualified for this position given my past jobs and academic courses. I’m currently doing a minor in business and have taken multiple business courses in high school. This is a great opportunity for me to not only improve the finance department but to meet new people and form connections as well. If I am elected, I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure to improve the current budget or create a new one if the need be. I’ll make sure that it benefits and accounts for all department&amp;rsquo;s and individuals’ needs. Furthermore, I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure to request financial aid from the administration and other organizations to make sure all our planned events run smoothly and according to plan.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Forest's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/vice-president/forest/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/vice-president/forest/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Forest!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a 4th year student in the Game Development stream. I&amp;rsquo;m also Carleton&amp;rsquo;s Github Campus Expert; one of fewer than 10 in Canada. I&amp;rsquo;m a big advocate of open source development, primarily as a core developer of Veloren. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m a contributor to the Rust language, where I focus on the community as a lead of the CTCFT team and the gamedev working group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the Vice President of the Carleton Computer Science Society, I would focus on empowering the other members of the board. As a previous exec of several years, I want to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned with the future leaders of computer science at Carleton. In my opinion, the society thrives most when board members help one another, and I want to play that support role for the team.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Matthew's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/president/matthew/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/president/matthew/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey There, I&amp;rsquo;m Matthew!

&lt;p>I’m in the game development stream and I have a secret - I don’t play games! When I was in my first game design class, I noticed the disappointment of my classmates when they realized the first assignment was a written piece where we had to analyze any game we enjoyed. The professor brought up our obvious disappointment and explained that often kids go into game development since they just like playing games and only want to build them. This isn’t quite how making games work. There are so many elements that turn a game into a ‘great’ game, and just playing them is not enough. Generally when you make games, it’s not about you - you’re on the other side of the screen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Victor's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/finance/victor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/finance/victor/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey Everyone! My name is Victor Li, and this will be my second year running for the Director of Finance. I have a lot of experience doing personal and club finances from high school and CCSS. Some of my goals for this year are to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
Continue selling hoodies and other merchandise like t-shirts, pins, and laptop stickers using new designs and possibly use designs from the 2021-2022 Hoodie contest with artists' approval.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
Document our finances into two accounts instead of one. I will record the Lounge's earnings and expenses separately from the society's academic and social events. We can use our earnings from the Lounge to vote on future equipment or more significant scale events during our general meeting.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
Move away from spreadsheets and towards professional accounting software to improve the ease of maintaining society accounts and bookkeeping.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
Promote the importance of the role of the treasurer while being transparent and accountable with our finances.
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The challenge of managing budgets and money can be complicated. Still, using the knowledge I&amp;rsquo;ve gained through past administrative experience, I am willing to take on this challenge and make our finances as straightforward and uncomplicated as possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project Showcase</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/academic/2021-03-05-project-showcase/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/academic/2021-03-05-project-showcase/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Studying from home has its pros and cons. I made the decision to study abroad to get international exposure and experience the unique university life but due to the current situation, I have to accept the fact that I have to study online for one year, which has been the biggest con. I figured that pouting about it won’t work and that I just have to accept that fact and try and make the most of it so here is my experience so far with being an international online CS student.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Database Paradigms</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/academic/2021-01-27-database-paradigms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/academic/2021-01-27-database-paradigms/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>With the dire situation in Ottawa and the amounting of cases, the city and quite frankly, anywhere, can get pretty lonely sometimes. Thankfully Computer Science students seem to hold their ground during the pandemic as our species seems to never poke our heads out of the safety and warmth of our rooms. However, as comparable as we are to the furry little groundhogs at Carleton, our lifestyle is still being affected more than meets the eye, especially in our classes.

&lt;p>Rainbow CSV is a column highlighter to help people read CSV and TSV files. In addition, it provides information about a column on hover. With CSVLint, there is an automatic consistency check for CSV files. With the RBQL console, users can view the data in a colourful table format and run queries in an SQL-like language. From my experiences, Rainbow CSV helps me read and edit CSV files. I like the colour-coded columns to help organize the CSV data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trivia Night: Jackbox Edition</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/social/2020-11-20-trivia-night-jackbox-edition/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/social/2020-11-20-trivia-night-jackbox-edition/</guid><description/></item><item><title>2020 Herzberg Lecture</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/society/2020-11-18-herzberg-lecture/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/society/2020-11-18-herzberg-lecture/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Hello everyone! It is my great pleasure to be running for CCSS President once again. In my three years of experience on the CCSS Board of Directors, I have amassed a varied skillset and informed insight on the way the society operates. The society has undergone many changes and significant growth under my governance over the past year. I plan to continue this trajectory as your president for next year. If re-elected,I will 1) advocate to the School of Computer Science and the Faculty of Science for an increase in dedicated space on campus for CS students; 2) create more opportunities for our student body to get involved in the society&amp;rsquo;s activities (e.g. facilitating event collaboration with experienced students, reforming Carleton DevClub, increasing student-prof interaction); and 3) improve the quality of the society&amp;rsquo;s current services (e.g. establishing higher standards for event organization, increasing funding for lounge services, bettering communication to students through relevant social media). It&amp;rsquo;s time for the CCSS to fill its shoes as a society that represents all of Carleton University&amp;rsquo;s undergraduate CS students. So when you&amp;rsquo;re filling out your ballots, just remember: where there&amp;rsquo;s a Will, there&amp;rsquo;s a way! As always, I am open to any feedback you may have. Please contact me by email via &lt;a href="mailto:william.so@ccss.carleton.ca">william.so@ccss.carleton.ca&lt;/a> for questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding my candidacy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Winter General Meeting</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2019-2020/society/2020-02-12-winter-general-meeting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2019-2020/society/2020-02-12-winter-general-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Hi everyone! I’m an international student from India and I’m excited to be a part of Carleton University and the CCSS. So, a little bit about me.
I’m a huge soccer buff and an MCU fan (fight me, DC fan bois.) I love trivia and quizzing and just love fiddling around with the computer but also, making friends and meeting new people, in general. I would be honoured to be an FYR for the CCSS, and to be the voice of all the first-year students who are often looked over. I promise that I will listen to what everyone has to say and feed your opinions to the rest of the exec board if I’m chosen. I’ve previously assumed leadership roles in high school so I know the responsibilities that such a position demands. I have plenty of exciting plans for the CCSS in general but also to ensure fun participation for all the first years. So, do vote for me and I will not let you down. Cheers!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Week of Awesome: Picnic On The Beach</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2019-2020/social/2019-09-14-picnic-on-the-beach/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2019-2020/social/2019-09-14-picnic-on-the-beach/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Throughout my academic career over the past two years at Carleton University, I have been heavily involved with the CCSS - as a First Year Representative last year, and as the current VP Social. In that time, I have gained many great experiences, and learned a lot about organizing student events and making important decisions with a team of people. However, I have also seen firsthand the pitfalls that can arise with the way our current administration operates, and I believe that it is time for me to address the prevalent issues that we face as your next CCSS President.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CCSS Coffee Social</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2018-2019/social/2019-03-12-coffee-social/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2018-2019/social/2019-03-12-coffee-social/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Hey, first-years!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may have heard some talk over the past few days about first year reps. But what is a first year rep, and what does it entail to hold one such position? For the CCSS, First Year Reps are the voice of the first-year students in computer science. They help advertise our events to new students, and they can run events and initiatives of their own as well. First Year Reps are members of the CCSS Board of Directors, and get to have a say on all important decisions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VP WiCS Announcement</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2018-2019/2018-09-08-vp-wics-announcement/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/2018-2019/2018-09-08-vp-wics-announcement/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/news/2020-2021/vote.jpg" alt="election">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past few months, the Board of Directors of the CCSS has been discussing the possibility of creating a new position to collaborate with the WiCS (Women in Computer Science) group on campus. We are pleased to announce that we will be welcoming a new position to the CCSS, VP WiCS!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CCSS hopes to place a bigger importance on diversity efforts in the following years to come. VP WiCS will be a dedicated a position on the Board of Directors that will lead these diversity efforts, ensuring the events and atmosphere of the computer science society is welcoming and inclusive. Many students have expressed interest in this initiative while we conducted surveys during Summer 2018. We hope that this change will connect CCSS and WiCS more closely so that the community is less divided. By making it a crucial part of the CCSS elections, we hope to stabilize the governance structure within WiCS to ensure the longevity of the group.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coffee Social</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2017-2018/social/2018-04-03-coffee-social/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2017-2018/social/2018-04-03-coffee-social/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>First drink is free for Computer Science students and faculty but to help manage numbers we ask you to come pick up your drink ticket in advance at the Computer Science Society office, HP 4135, starting Tuesday, Feb 13th.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ladies Learning Code: Introduction to Ruby</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2017-2018/community/2018-02-24-ladies-learning-code/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2017-2018/community/2018-02-24-ladies-learning-code/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For this workshop, we say good bye to the web browser and hello to our computer, literally. Ruby is one of the many languages your computer understands and that you can use to speak to it, but is known for being more elegant and natural compared to other programming languages. Ruby doesn’t use semi-colons, preventing those annoying errors that seem to happen for no reason, and often requires fewer lines of code to accomplish the same things as other languages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tech Talk: Application Security</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2017-2018/academic/2018-02-05-application-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2017-2018/academic/2018-02-05-application-security/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is a First Year Rep?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First Year Reps are elected positions (that&amp;rsquo;s right, first years will need to vote for their two reps) for first years to get a chance to be a part of the CCSS board of directors. They represent all of the CS first years at meetings and help advertise our events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Their role includes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Representing first year computer science students&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attend meetings of the board&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advertise events to first year students&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run their own initiatives and/or events&lt;/li>

Since you already know how to code, referencing the docs to learn the basic syntax is a quick way to start coding in Python. But how do you learn the Pythonic way? The ecosystem? Patterns and anti-patterns? 1) join the Python community. 2) Come and see this talk!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Week of Awesome: Coffee Social</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2016-2017/social/2016-09-12-coffee-social/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2016-2017/social/2016-09-12-coffee-social/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>
