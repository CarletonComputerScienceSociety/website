What is SaPP? Students as Partners Program(SaPP for short) is a 1-2 term project, where you create/develop curriculum resources for a professor&amp;rsquo;s class. It can range from a website that shows how something is done to articles on what to focus on in a course. An example of something that could be but isn&amp;rsquo;t an SaPP project is DiscreteMath.</description></item><item><title>COMP 1405 Final Study Session</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2023-2024/2023-12-17-comp-1405-final-study-session/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2023-2024/2023-12-17-comp-1405-final-study-session/</guid><description>Slides The presetation slides can be viewed here!

There are also many different skill sets in use, with development to the frontend of websites, backend web servers, and even some other tooling in the middle.</description></item><item><title>2804 Study Session</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2022-04-16-2804-study-session/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2022-04-16-2804-study-session/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Speed Friending</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2022-04-12-speed-friending/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2022-04-12-speed-friending/</guid><description/></item><item><title>CCSS General Election Results 2022-2023</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/election-results-2022-2023/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/election-results-2022-2023/</guid><description>A complete breakdown of the election results can be seen in the PDF here.

My name is Sahil, and I’m running to be your First-Year rep at the CCSS! Having oranised and participated in various hackathons, seminars and workshops, I’ve concluded that the best way to grow as a professional in today’s tech scene is by developing soft skills; something that a classroom environment often fails to deliver.

Schooling during a global pandemic leaves much to be desired, but I hope to make the best out of our situation and create an online and offline community that we can all thrive in! I would do this by (A) looking for more beginner-friendly events, as some people are learning comp sci for the first time (B) organize game nights for some quality social time and (C) create opportunities to interact with upper years because a little guidance is always useful!</description></item><item><title>Shirley Zhan's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/shirley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/shirley/</guid><description>Hello everyone, I’m Shirley.Z and I’m running for CCSS’s first-year rep! I’m going to make this really short since I know everyone’s really busy.

Create an active discussion on how to network and explain how it helps you make friends, learn knowledge fast and helps you land an internship!</description></item><item><title>Spyfall</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-09-24-spyfall/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-09-24-spyfall/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dev Club</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-09-22-dev-club/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-09-22-dev-club/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Inferring the Algorithms Used by Different Processes Using Machine Learning</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/inferring-the-algorithms-used-by-different-processes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/inferring-the-algorithms-used-by-different-processes/</guid><description>Abstract: Some natural and human-engineered processes exhibit patterns that suggest an underlying algorithm. For natural processes, this could be thought of as the biochemical processes dictated by genes or other natural forces. For human-engineered processes, such algorithms represent either memetic thought within a culture or the physical limitations and requirements for human use. This research has examined inferring the algorithms used by such processes from data observed over time. For example, taking a sequence of photos of a plant as it grows can be used to infer the algorithm used by the plant to grow.</description></item><item><title>Clubs &amp; Societies Info Session</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-09-18-clubs-info-session/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-09-18-clubs-info-session/</guid><description>Description To kick off (and close off) the CCSS&amp;rsquo;s Week of Awesome, we are collaborating with clubs and societies affiliated with the School of Computer Science (SCS) to bring you an exciting, virtual CS Clubs &amp;amp; Societies Information Session!

Although the open source mindset has been around since the early days of operating system development, it has only become mainstream in the last decade due to advances in how we communicate and share code. Many companies are shifting towards tech stacks that are in part or are entirely open source.

I’m Aaditya Chopra (or you could just call me Adi) and I’m running to be your Director of Social for this year’s board of directors!
I’m someone who’s really passionate about getting involved with the student body, as well as event planning and having some fun, while also connecting with other people! As such, I would love to bring that passion to the board of directors this year as we transition from this weird online/in-person phase.</description></item><item><title>Amelie's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/academics/amelie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/academics/amelie/</guid><description>Hello world! My name is Amelie Haefele and I&amp;rsquo;m going into my third year here at Carleton while currently living on residence. I promise to encourage the academic opportunities and learning of all students in Carleton’s Computer Science Society and any others who wish to join. With the move to online many, including myself have found it much harder to learn.
To combat this I plan to create online and in person events so everyone can choose which medium they prefer.</description></item><item><title>Fahim's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/finance/fahim/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/finance/fahim/</guid><description>I would like to run for the Director of Finance because it&amp;rsquo;s a great opportunity for me to improve my current skills and give back to the computer science community. Ever since I came to Carleton I wanted to be as involved in the community as I could. Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;m well qualified for this position given my past jobs and academic courses. I’m currently doing a minor in business and have taken multiple business courses in high school.</description></item><item><title>Forest's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/vice-president/forest/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/vice-president/forest/</guid><description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Forest!
I&amp;rsquo;m a 4th year student in the Game Development stream. I&amp;rsquo;m also Carleton&amp;rsquo;s Github Campus Expert; one of fewer than 10 in Canada. I&amp;rsquo;m a big advocate of open source development, primarily as a core developer of Veloren. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m a contributor to the Rust language, where I focus on the community as a lead of the CTCFT team and the gamedev working group.
As the Vice President of the Carleton Computer Science Society, I would focus on empowering the other members of the board.</description></item><item><title>Matthew's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/president/matthew/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/president/matthew/</guid><description>Hey There, I&amp;rsquo;m Matthew!
