I&rsquo;m running for CCSS President, and here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hoping to accomplish during my term:</p><h3 id=1-bigger-focus-on-development-opportunities>1. Bigger Focus on Development Opportunities</h3><p><strong>The problem:</strong></br>The CCSS hasn&rsquo;t consistently planned initiatives that help students build development skills outside of coursework. We often give students the advice that they need personal projects to stand out, but don&rsquo;t provide enough structured support to actually help them do that.</p><p><strong>If elected, I will:</strong></p><ul><li>Revive <strong><a href=https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-10-27-dev-club-show-and-tell/>Dev Club</a></strong> - regular sessions where students can work on personal or group projects, receive mentorship, and showcase what they&rsquo;re building (with free snacks!)</li><li>Organize technical workshops covering practical skills relevant to today&rsquo;s industry but not taught in courses.</li></ul><p><strong>Goal:</strong></br>Students go into internship and full-time job searches with stronger portfolios and hands-on development experience.</p><h3 id=2-making-sure-ccss-initiatives-reach-every-student>2. Making Sure CCSS Initiatives Reach Every Student</h3><p><strong>The problem:</strong></br>Most events only benefit students who can make a specific 1–2 hour time slot. If you have a class, work, or anything else going on, you miss out entirely.</p><p><strong>If elected, I will:</strong></p><ul><li>Set a strong precedent for our new content creation role and use it to reach students who aren&rsquo;t able to attend our events in person.</li><li>Turn key events and useful information into short videos and posts, and use our platforms to spotlight what Carleton CS students are building and achieving.</li></ul><p><strong>Goal:</strong></br>More students benefit from our initiatives regardless of their schedule, and the CCSS becomes something students can actually follow and engage with on their own time.</p><h3 id=3-better-collaboration-with-other-clubs>3. Better Collaboration with Other Clubs</h3><p><strong>The problem:</strong></br>Clubs often run overlapping events that force students to choose between them. We also now have increased funding through the levy that can be used more strategically to support initiatives that directly benefit CS students.</p><p><strong>If elected, I will:</strong></p><ul><li>Work closely with other clubs to coordinate scheduling and co-host events where it makes sense, rather than competing for the same time slots.</li><li>Introduce a formal process for tech clubs to apply for funding to support events that directly benefit CS students, such as those run by the Cybersecurity Club, Game Dev Club, AI Society, and others.</li></ul><p><strong>Goal:</strong></br>Students get higher quality events, fewer scheduling conflicts, and more opportunities to meet people across the broader tech community at Carleton.</p><h3 id=4-a-more-intentional-event-calendar>4. A More Intentional Event Calendar</h3><p><strong>The problem:</strong></br>Many events are planned last minute or scheduled at the wrong point in the year. For example, running a &ldquo;how to prep for job applications&rdquo; presentation after students have already started applying.</p><p><strong>If elected, I will:</strong></p><ul><li>Establish a roadmap at the start of the year and plan major initiatives around when they&rsquo;re actually useful for students.</li><li>Structure the event calendar so it naturally guides students. If we&rsquo;re running a &ldquo;Personal Projects 101&rdquo; workshop in October, that&rsquo;s your cue to start working on projects.</li></ul><p><strong>Goal:</strong></br>Students get the right support at the right time and can be proactive about their academics and careers, not just reactive.</p></p><hr></div></div><div class=operations-candidates><div class="position operations"><h2 id=kimia>Kimia Khorram-Roudi - Director of Operations</h2><p><p>Hello everyone!</p><p><strong>My name is Kimia, your current Director of Operations</strong> and I am running in hopes of being re-elected as your Director of Operations for the upcoming <strong>2026-2027</strong> academic year. I would be honoured to continue in this role to help further your experience here at Carleton University and with the society while also simultaneously continuing to support the behind-the-scenes here at the Carleton Computer Science Society.</p><p>During my time here, I have volunteered with the CCSS at numerous events and also continuously attended meetings and contributed to various discussions and initiatives. I previously ran for Director of Operations last year because I knew I wanted to contribute even more and help others in my program feel more comfortable, supported and welcomed while also supporting and ensuring everything stays on track at the CS society. I believe having a society / club that runs events and services and that also creates content and resources for the student population it represents will truly help make the University experience even better.</p><p>If re-elected, I plan to:</p><h3 id=1-continue-to-support-volunteers->1. Continue to support volunteers 🤝</h3><p>I wish to support students by answering any question they may have and ensuring all students have the opportunity to contribute and help out when needed and when they are interested. I will ensure students are given proper and constant support on whatever they do in regards to the society and will be sure to schedule and assign them appropriately depending on what they are interested in and their availability. This would apply to Lounge shifts and operations, Hackathons, major events and smaller scale initiatives and I would ensure volunteers have all the information they need to complete their tasks accordingly.</p><h3 id=2-represent-students-voices-and-visions->2. Represent students voices and visions 🗣️</h3><p>Continuously seek out student feedback and open discussions in order to ensure the wants, needs and concerns of students are met in the society by releasing feedback forms, reaching out to volunteers and promoting appropriate discussion in-person and online.</p><h3 id=3-promote-the-ccss-lounge->3. Promote the CCSS Lounge 🛋️</h3><p>Located at Herzberg 4135, this is a space that is designed to provide a comfortable and welcoming environment for CS and Cybersecurity students to relax, chat and create new relationships and connections. I plan to pursue promoting and supporting lounge initiatives by hosting more events in the room, managing operations and upgrades related to the lounge to elevate the space along with publicly promoting the room more so more people are aware of it and can benefit from it.</p><p>I am always open to new ideas and suggestions! If you have any questions, thoughts or concerns please feel free to reach out! I am almost always in the CCSS Lounge and you can also find me in the CCSS Discord Server :)</p></p><hr></div></div><div class=finance-candidates><div class="position finance"><h2 id=adrian>Adrian Ponce - Director of Finance</h2><p><p>Hello everyone! My name is Adrian Ponce. I’m a Computer Science Software Engineering student entering my third year while minoring in Finance. My vision as your Director of Finance is built on three pillars:</p><h3 id=1-strengthening-our-societys-financial-stability>1. 📈Strengthening our society’s financial stability:</h3><p>A critical window to strengthen our society’s financial future relies on Ontario’s historic $6.4 billion investment in the postsecondary sector, which is stabilizing university budgets and expanding high-demand programs like computer science. As Director of Finance, I will ensure the CCSS is ready to take advantage of this moment by planning strategically, managing our resources responsibly, and advocating for new funding and opportunities our growing community deserves. This is the ideal time for strong leadership to secure additional university support and funding so we can better serve every CCSS member.</p><h3 id=2-raising-new-funding-that-aligns-with-our-societys-core-values>2. 🚀Raising new funding that aligns with our society&rsquo;s core values:</h3><p>As your Director of Finance, the following strengths of our society will be my priority. They are the experiences that define our society and enrich your time in the program.</p><p><strong>Professional Events with Industry Speakers</strong>: These events help us understand the jobs of tomorrow and how to prepare for them today by exposing us to:</p><ul><li>Future career paths</li><li>Skills and qualities employers are looking for</li><li>Real-world insights into the tech industry</li></ul><p><strong>Community, Networking, and Student Life</strong>: Activities like hackathons, game nights, and movie nights are more than just fun. They help you:</p><ul><li>Expand your connections</li><li>Strengthen friendships</li><li>Grow academically, socially, and professionally</li></ul><p><strong>My Plan For Creating Funding Opportunities</strong>: My strategy is simple - play the numbers game and maximize our reach. I will contact tech companies, especially startups and growing companies seeking talent. I will work with fellow members of CCSS to secure guest speakers, sponsorships, and donations. In exchange, we will offer direct access to a talented pool of students seeking professional opportunities (ie. co-ops). It’s a win-win model that strengthens both our society and your career prospects.</p><p><strong>Merchandise: Hoodies, T-Shirts, and More</strong>: I will introduce CCSS merchandise so students can proudly represent their program and faculty:</p><ul><li>Students vote on design options →</li><li>Winning design becomes official merch →</li><li>Hoodies, t-shirts, and other items can now be purchased →</li><li>Portion of the profit goes directly back to CCSS 🌟</li></ul><p>This creates both community spirit and a sustainable revenue stream to support future events.</p><h3 id=3-ensuring-full-transparency-in-how-your-money-is-used>3. 🔎Ensuring full transparency in how your money is used:</h3><p>As Director of Finance, I will ensure complete transparency by:</p><ul><li>Posting weekly budget updates on the CCSS website</li><li>Clearly outlining how funds are allocated</li><li>Ensuring spending aligns with student priorities</li></ul><p>You will always know where your money is going.</p><p>As we look ahead to a year full of opportunity and possibility, I’m asking for your trust and your vote. I’m ready to work hard, advocate for our needs, and build a stronger financial future for the CCSS that best serves you. Thank you!</p><p>Questions?

My name&rsquo;s Michael and I&rsquo;m running to be your next Director of Finance.</p><p>With this year&rsquo;s introduction of the levy, we over budget for new costs like insurance. This leaves us with a surplus of funds to act as a buffer that we can maintain year over year, helping to ensure the long term stability of the society. With this year&rsquo;s costs in mind, going forward, we can allocate more to initiatives that benefit each and every one of you.</p><h3 id=increase-funding-for-events>Increase funding for events</h3><p>With increased funding, we can host larger, more exciting events. Additionally, it’s no secret that the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; could make university students scale mountains. That’s why every CCSS event offers free food, ranging from snacks and coffee, to pizza, to veggie and fruit platters.</p><p>If elected, I will ensure that our budgetIf elected, I will ensure that our budget is revised to better support large events like company <strong>networking events</strong> and <strong>hackathons</strong> through increased funding for <strong>food</strong>, <strong>prizes</strong>, and whatever else may be required.</p><h3 id=offer-funding-for-other-clubs>Offer funding for other clubs</h3><p>Computer Science is a wide field, with many clubs catering to particular specializations. Some of these you may recognize include the Carleton Cybersecurity Club, the Carleton Game Development Club, Carleton Blueprint, and the Carleton AI Society. These clubs are extremely valuable to our community, but don’t have access to all the funding opportunities available to the CCSS.</p><p>If elected, I will introduce a formal process through which clubs serving Computer Science and Cybersecurity students can apply to receive funding for events and initiatives, enabling them to <strong>better support</strong> the CS community.</p><h3 id=invest-in-the-lounge>Invest in the lounge</h3><p>The lounge is a space that has long served our community, providing a space to relax, work, chat, or even just microwave your lunch.</p><p>If elected, I will continue to support the lounge through <strong>practical</strong> investment in the areas that will have the greatest impact on student enjoyment of the space, like <strong>better tables and seating</strong>. Of course, I will seek feedback on the current space from students, especially those who are regulars around the lounge, to ensure the needs of the <strong>community</strong> are met.</p><h3 id=release-new-clothing-and-other-merch>Release new clothing and other merch</h3><p>This year, the CCSS has been hard at work trying to release new official merchandise. They are off to a good start having already released a variety of new, student-designed stickers.</p><p>If elected, I will work to release new, <strong>student-designed</strong>, high quality clothing that you can feel <strong>proud to wear</strong>.</p><h3 id=improve-financial-transparency>Improve financial transparency</h3><p>The CCSS receives our funding primarily from you, the students. For that reason, it is crucial that we are transparent with our use of funds so that we may be held accountable. The processes surrounding budgeting and financial transparency have long been janky and inconsistent.</p><p>If elected, I will strive to introduce new processes that reduce management overhead and improve transparency. I will implement reasonable <strong>deadlines</strong> for publishing the budget publicly online after the Fall and Winter general meetings. Additionally, to improve transparency and accountability, I will make available online <strong>all historical budgets</strong>.</p></p><hr></div><div class="position finance"><h2 id=nolan>Nolan German - Director of Finance</h2><p><p>Hello CCSS! My name is Nolan and I will be running for the Director of Finance for the 2026-27 school year. This year I will be going into my third year of CS with a minor in business. I would like to connect my knowledge of Business and Computer Science to help the CCSS raise and manage money. I plan on working closely with my fellow board members to bring more funding to the CCSS to create more events and opportunities for you!</p><p>Here are some of my ideas that I can bring to this role:</p><h3 id=-secure-more-funding>🪙 Secure more funding</h3><p>In order to create more hackathons and opportunities for Computer Science students we need more sponsors. I will find these sponsors by reaching out to as many tech companies, Carleton Alumni and tech startups as I can. While working with board members to be as efficient as possible.</p><h3 id=properly-allocate-money>🏦Properly Allocate Money</h3><p>With last year&rsquo;s levy, previous sponsors and new sponsors I want to put this money to good use. At the start of my term I will make a budget for the entire school year to make sure no money goes to waste. I will look over previous years spending and budgets to find what we did right and where we could improve. While keeping full transparency and posting the budget with updates each semester.</p><h3 id=listen-to-your-ideas>👂Listen to your ideas</h3><p>Through google forms and word of mouth I want to hear what you want to do with your money. With approximately $11,000 of funding from students you deserve a say of where this money goes. I want to set aside a portion of the budget for student and volunteer ideas so we can bring fresh new ideas to the CCSS.</p><h3 id=set-clear-goals>🎯Set Clear Goals</h3><p>I want to set achievable, ambitious and quantitative goals that will have a big impact on the CCSS. My first goal is to increase funding by at least %20 from last year.

It would be no overstatement to say that I am well versed in organizing and realizing large-scale student initiatives.</p><p>Having worked both with instructors and directly with students, I understand something important:</p><p>Academic support only works when it&rsquo;s structured, consistent, and accessible.</p><p>If elected, here&rsquo;s what I will focus on:</p><h3 id=structured-study-support>Structured Study Support</h3><p>I will:</p><ul><li>Coordinate midterm and final review sessions well in advance</li><li>Create consistent formats for sessions</li><li>Recruit strong upper year students and past TAs to lead them</li><li>Expand support beyond just 2804/2402 into high-demand courses</li></ul><p>My goal here is to have predictable, reliable academic support every semester.</p><h3 id=a-clear-student-to-faculty-feedback-pipeline>A Clear Student to Faculty Feedback Pipeline</h3><p>Students often feel like their concerns go unheard.</p><p>I will:</p><ul><li>Create structured feedback forms per course</li><li>Compile trends and communicate them directly to instructors</li><li>Follow up publicly (where appropriate) so students know their voices were heard</li></ul><p>Constructive communication, not complaints about the courses themselves, leads to real improvement.</p><h3 id=making-research-less-intimidating>Making Research Less Intimidating</h3><p>Many students are curious about research but do not know where to start. As someone who has taken on a DSRI (Dean Summer Research Internship), which turned into a Research Assistant role, I have working knowledge of learning where to start.</p><p>I will:</p><ul><li>Create guides and resources explaining DSRI, honours projects, undergrad research, and grad school paths.</li><li>Connect interested students with professors seeking research assistants.</li></ul><h3 id=making-myself-available>Making Myself Available</h3><p>If elected as a member of the CCSS board, I plan to make myself available to the entire student body. This means staying active in the Discord server, hanging out in the CCSS lounge, conducting regular surveys, and continuing my TAing efforts throughout various COMP courses.</p><p>As someone who has been through it all, I plan to help students with any questions or concerns they may have about the Carleton Computer Science program, and to help those whose voices should be heard.</p></p><hr></div><div class="position academics"><h2 id=sarah>Sarah Adnan - Director of Academics</h2><p><p>Hi everyone! I&rsquo;m Sarah and I&rsquo;m currently going into my second year of computer science in the cyber security stream.</p><p>    I want to run as Director of Academics at the Carleton Computer Science Society. I&rsquo;ve always been really passionate about creating an environment for my fellow peers where they feel supported, safe and empowered to succeed. Throughout my time in Carleton as a computer science student, I understand that right academic support is really important to succeed. A quiet place to study with like-minded people, access to practice problems, and a conversation with a person in the field can make the difference between feeling overwhelmed and feeling capable. I want to help build that support system for others. What really intrigued me about this position was its collaborative nature, and the fact that I&rsquo;m going to be able to work and connect with many people.</p><p>    If elected one of my top priorities would be to expand the study sessions. I would make it so that it has a clear schedule prioritizing midterm and finals season so people can drop in whenever they need help. I will also recruit upper-year students who have done well in the course to lead these study sessions and offer advice. In addition to that, I would love to highlight different academic pathways beyond coursework, such as undergraduate research, internships and graduate programs. Hosting Q&amp;A sessions or a discussion board with professors and other students who have pursued these opportunities can be helpful to students who didn’t know about these pathways and encourage them to explore beyond it as well. Overall, I am committed to making academic support more accessible and visible within the computer science community at Carleton. I don’t want students to feel alone in their academic journey and that there are always resources and people ready to support them.</p><p>Thank you so much for your consideration and have a great day!</p></p><hr></div><div class="position academics"><h2 id=sofia>Sofia Alhennawi - Director of Academics</h2><p><p>Hey everyone!! I’m Sofia, and I’m running for Director of Academics because I genuinely care about making Computer Science more accessible, more supportive, and less overwhelming!</p><p>To be honest, CS is a lot. We all know it. Confusing assignments, late night debugging, unsure of how to study, andddd imposter syndrome… feeling like you’re behind even when you’re trying your best&mldr; I know. It’s not easy, but I’m here to make sure YOU can easily access useful resources that will help you thrive!</p><p>As a First Year Representative, I’ve heard it all, the 3 a.m. debugging breakdowns, the “wait… what is this assignment asking?”, the pre-midterm panic.

I’m Rudraksh Sharma, and I am excited to announce that I will be running for the Director of Social this sem!!!</p><p>I’m running to be Director of Social for the Carleton Computer Science Society because Computer Science should be more than assignments, labs, and debugging at 2AM. Yes, we grind. Yes, we lock in. But we also deserve a community that’s loud, welcoming, and actually fun to be part of. University goes by fast, and I want to help make sure we don’t just remember the deadlines — we remember the people.</p><p>CS can feel intense and isolating sometimes. It’s easy to show up to class, code, and go home without really knowing the people around you. I want to change that. I want events where first-years instantly feel included, where upper-years actually show up, and where you walk in not knowing anyone and walk out with new friends (and maybe a Mario Kart rivalry). Being Director of Social isn’t about throwing random events — it’s about building energy, consistency, and excitement throughout the entire year.</p><p>Here’s what I plan to organize:</p><ul><li><p>🚀 Welcome Mixer (Start of Each Semester)<br>A high-energy kickoff event with structured but low-pressure icebreakers, team-based mini games, and speed-friending rounds so first-years can quickly meet a bunch of people. Upper-years will be encouraged to join so new students instantly feel welcomed instead of overwhelmed.</p></li><li><p>🎮 Monthly Game & Tournament Nights<br>Rotating themes each month — Mario Kart brackets, board game cafés, card tournaments, chess battles, or even coding mini-challenges. Small prizes, leaderboards, and friendly competition to keep it exciting and give people a reason to come back.</p></li><li><p>🧠✨ Midterm De-Stress Night<br>Right when assignments pile up, we host a chill evening with snacks, music, casual games, and relaxation activities. A space to take a break, breathe, and remember you’re not suffering through midterms alone.</p></li><li><p>💻🔥 Hackathon After-Social<br>After major coding events, we celebrate surviving them. Music, food, photo ops, and time to actually talk about what everyone built — turning competition into community.</p></li><li><p>☕ CS Coffee Chat Series<br>Smaller, cozy meetups where 10–15 students at a time can just talk, network, or hang out. Great for making real friendships instead of just quick event interactions.</p></li><li><p>🤝 Collab Events with Other Societies<br>Joint game nights, trivia battles, or themed socials with other programs so we can expand our circles beyond just CS.</p></li><li><p>🎉 End-of-Year Semi-Formal / Celebration Night<br>A fun, well-organized celebration to wrap up the year — music, photos, awards, and a chance to dress up and celebrate surviving another year of CS together.</p></li></ul><p>My focus is simple: more turnout, more hype, more memories. I want people to actually look forward to CCSS events instead of scrolling past the post. I’ll bring organization, creativity, and energy — but most importantly, I’ll bring consistency.</p><p>Let’s make this year the one where the CS community feels alive.</p></p><hr></div></div><div class=industry-candidates><div class="position industry"><h2 id=afaq>Afaq Virk - Director of Industry Initiatives</h2><p><h3 id=reasons-to-vote-afaq-virk-as-director-of-industry-initiatives->REASONS to VOTE AFAQ VIRK as Director of Industry Initiatives 🔥🔥🔥</h3><ul><li><p><strong>I am industrious</strong> 🤑 (<em>2 years of internship experience + 5 years managing a business</em>) I understand both sides of the table: what employers expect, and what students actually need.

I definitely have.🙋‍♀️</p><p>Maybe it was job search advice that actually helped. Shared struggles in a course that made you feel less alone (looking at you Discrete Structures). A cool CS opportunity you didn&rsquo;t even know existed.

I know what you&rsquo;re thinking: &ldquo;<em>we already have a CCSS Instagram, website, discord…</em>&rdquo; - Well I think I speak for a lot of us when I say we don&rsquo;t just want event posters. We want more relatable, helpful, and engaging content that actually captures what it&rsquo;s like to be a Carleton CS student!</p><p>And well that&rsquo;s the gap I want to fill!

I want to make sure that energy doesn&rsquo;t just disappear when the room clears out. If you missed it, you shouldn&rsquo;t feel like you missed everything. Think highlight reels, short videos, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Practical guides/short reels for the stuff nobody teaches you</strong>: What do you put on a resume with no experience? What do you even say at a networking event? I want to make guides for the &ldquo;stuff no one tells you about&rdquo; and for the questions we&rsquo;re all googling at 3am during our mid-life crisis crashouts (can&rsquo;t just be me 😔).</p></li><li><p><strong>Bring in people worth hearing from</strong>: Alumni, grad students, engineers, recruiters - there&rsquo;s genuinely so much useful insight just one conversation away. I want to create interview content that feels more like a podcast episode than a career fair booth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Content that makes you feel seen!</strong>: Being in the cs program can sometimes feel isolating behind a screen. I want to create content that reminds you you&rsquo;re not alone in this - relatable struggles, shared experiences, memes, and more.</p></li></ul><p>This also includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Student Spotlights</strong>: cool projects, niche hobbies, internship experiences, etc.</li><li><strong>Professor Spotlights</strong>: quick, informal, fun features with the faculty! (I genuinely want to know what my professor&rsquo;s favourite TV shows are)</li></ul><p>Wow, you actually read all that - you&rsquo;re a real one 😎 Thanks for reading!
