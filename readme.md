# CCSS Website

## Setup

### 1. Installation

This website is built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.

To setup Hugo, follow the Hugo authored [tutorial](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for your operating system of choice.

Mac :

```bash

brew install hugo

```

For Windows users, I recommend following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7umPCU-8xc) if you are unfamilliar with choco.

You will need to install the latest "hugo_extended" version. This can be found on the [Hugo releases page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases).

### 2. Start Hugo

To start Hugo, navigate to the directory where you cloned this project and run the following command:

```bash

hugo server

```

## Content Generators

```bash

hugo new events/<event-name>.md

```

```bash

hugo new news/<news-name>.md

```

## Prettier

npm is only used for adding developer dependencies and does not interface with hugo in anyway. The main dependency is prettier.

```bash
npm install
npm run format
```
