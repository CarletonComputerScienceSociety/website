Please join us on Monday, September 7 from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM EDT to attend a panel of fellow international students ranging from 2nd to 4th year, who chose to study computer science at Carleton, just like you! They will be talking about their experiences as international students in CS and answering any questions or concerns that you may have! We will also have a representative from the International Student Services Office (ISSO) who will be doing a short presentation on all the resources Carleton has to offer you. <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNoQMMfY74p3z4UTDU8UBSQJ9M1aCder-WTXsn3VrdzJWTXw/viewform>Register for the event here!</a> This panel will take place in Microsoft Teams.

We are looking for two passionate individuals to join our exec team as first-year representatives for the 2020-2021 academic year. The first-year rep positions are a chance for first-year students to take part in the governance of the CCSS. This means participating in internal meetings, being involved in the creation and planning of our events and initiatives, and having voting power in all important decisions for the year. Nominations will begin on Tuesday, September 8 - make sure to keep checking your Carleton email so you don&rsquo;t miss the nomination form! More info will be coming soon!</p><h1 id=ccss-dev-club>CCSS Dev Club</h1><p>Do you have ideas for personal coding projects but aren&rsquo;t sure how to get started? Do you want to practice skills that you&rsquo;ve learned in class in fun ways with your peers? Are you interested in learning more about tech and its real-world applications? If so, check out CCSS&rsquo;s Dev Club! Starting on Wednesday, September 23, Dev Club will run weekly at 6:00 PM Eastern Time on the <a href=https://discord.com/invite/VdxStVE>CCSS Discord server</a>. Meetings will alternate between group discussion sessions (where students will have the opportunity to share their ideas, make progress on their own side projects, and participate in fun coding activities), and tech talks hosted by knowledgeable student volunteers. &ndash; All this and even more to come for the rest of the year!</p><p>As always, you can reach us by email via <a href=mailto:info@ccss.carleton.ca>info@ccss.carleton.ca</a> if you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns. We wish you all the best in the Fall semester. See you at Academic Orientation!</p><p>Cheers, The CCSS Team</p></div></article></div></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:info@ccss.carleton.ca>info@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
