I am an international student that came from Qatar and really looking forward to getting the school year started as the first year rep for the CCSS! I enjoy basketball, football, gaming and anime so dont hesitate to say hi to me if you ever see me around campus. As for why I should be elected for the position:</p><ul><li>I am a social person so bridging the gap between the first years and upper year students is something that comes naturally and I would represent the collective mass of the first year CS students and voice their concerns and opinions.</li><li>I held executive positions at my school for many years so I know how to work from behind the scenes, ranging from planning activities to adjusting the budget to speaking in front of others, assuring that any events organized by me turn out to be great.</li><li>CS is an ever changing field and the CCSS has been a constant point, exisisting for 20+ years. I have a passion for the field of computer science,and using this passion to better the experience of other first year students and representing them would be a great honor.</li></ul><p>Once again I would like to thank you for reading my segment and I implore you to vote for me in the upcoming election. Regardless if you vote for me as your #1 candidate I wish you all the best of luck in the upcoming year :).</p></p></div><div id="Chris Challis" class="position fyr"><h2>Chris Challis</h2><p><p><img src=/images/first_year_reps/2022/chris.png alt=Chris></p><p>Hi there! I’m Chris, and this fall I’m hoping to be elected as one of your First-Year Representatives! You’ll find some of the things I look forward to doing if I am elected listed in the points below. If you’d like to contact me, feel free to send me an email at <a href=mailto:christopherchallis@cmail.carleton.ca>christopherchallis@cmail.carleton.ca</a> or send me a message on discord at CoffeeChris#9305.</p><h3 id=-represent-all-first-years-within-the-ccss>📣 Represent all First-Years within the CCSS!</h3><p>If I were to be elected as a First Year Representative my top priority would be to listen to and represent all of the interests, ideas, questions and concerns coming from the first-year students in the CCSS.</p><h3 id=-a-vote-for-first-years-interest>🗳️ A vote for First-Years’ interest!</h3><p>I would ensure that each of the first-year members of the CCSS will have their voices represented during internal meetings when events and initiatives are being organized, and make sure that the first-year students have a vote when vital decisions are being made for the year.</p><h3 id=-fun-events-and-ways-to-get-involved>🎉 Fun events and ways to get involved!</h3><p>If elected, I would take the opportunity to organize fun events for first-year students. The aim of these events would be to get first-years involved and connected with CCSS and the larger computer science community at Carleton. The nature of these events would be influenced by the wider first-year body so that the events will appeal to everyone who wants to come out and participate.</p><h3 id=-academic-support-for-ccss-members>📝 Academic support for CCSS members!</h3><p>With the switch back to in-person learning, many are nervous about academics. During the busy and stressful exam seasons, I’d like to organize study or discussion groups to allow for effective review and give First-Years the opportunity to go over difficult concepts with others who are in the same boat.</p><h3 id=-online-support-for-those-who-want-to-get-involved-remotely>🌐 Online support for those who want to get involved remotely!</h3><p>Some First-Year members of the CCSS may be unable to be on campus. I’d aim to provide connection and involvement for First Year members of the CCSS remotely in order to ensure that they can be involved in the community even if they are unable to do so in person.</p><h3 id=-open-communication-with-other-members>📞 Open communication with other members!</h3><p>In order to best represent first-year members, I’d keep myself available and open to feedback, ideas or any other things that first-year members may want to share with me. I’d do this in order to be and offer the best representation of the interest of first-years within the society.</p></p></div><div id="Colin McCormack" class="position fyr"><h2>Colin McCormack</h2><p><p><img src=/images/first_year_reps/2022/colin.jpg alt=Colin></p><h2 id=hello>Hello!</h2><h3 id=my-name-is-colin-and-i-am-running-to-be-your-first-year-representative>My name is Colin, and I am running to be your First Year Representative!</h3><p>I&rsquo;d like to be your first year representative in the CCSS, so I can collaborate with current members, as well as with Industry partners, to offer:</p><ul><li>more workshops,</li><li>more coding challenges,</li><li>and more events</li></ul><p>As an off-campus student, one of the first things I&rsquo;d like to do is to <strong>coordinate a physical space on campus where students can attend their first year computer science lectures that have been moved online (1405 - sections A, B, C), by reaching out to Professors and the Computer Science department.</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;ll always be open to suggestions and feedback from fellow students on the types of activities and issues that are important to you.</p><p>About me:</p><ul><li>I live off campus and hate the 88</li><li>I&rsquo;m passionate about AWS, <a href=https://github.com/colin-mccormack>my personal projects</a>, and soccer (specifically FC Bayern Munich)</li><li>I like using JetBrains editors, and I&rsquo;m a big fan of the <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students>JetBrains Student Program</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI">Tabs > Spaces</a></li></ul></p></div><div id="Hassan Ali" class="position fyr"><h2>Hassan Ali</h2><p><p><img src=/images/first_year_reps/2022/hassan.jpg alt=Hassan></p><p>Hey, I&rsquo;m Hassan Ali! Like all of you, I&rsquo;m a first-year computer science student. After attending the CCSS Fall general meeting and a few of the other amazing events this week, I decided to run for First Year Representative as I believe that I could have a real impact on the Carleton Computer Science Society.</p><p>At the Fall Meeting, there were a few issues that I could address as your First-Year Rep:</p><ol><li>They needed more staff in order to plan more events for the students</li><li>They wanted more volunteers and more ideas</li><li>They wanted a spokesperson for the first years that can convey their sentiments and criticisms to the board of the CCSS</li></ol><h4 id=1-events>1. Events</h4><p>In line with the first point, I would try to organize and plan many more events for the first years. These events may include activities like escape rooms or movie nights, or they may be something more club-related. I know that many students want to join a club but may not know what those clubs do or what they offer even after attending the expo. My plan is to communicate with the various clubs on campus to give a more comprehensive demonstration of what their clubs do as an activity for us first years!</p><h4 id=2-volunteering-and-community-ideas>2. Volunteering and Community Ideas</h4><p>Concerning the second point, I would use surveys and face-to-face discussions to try to help you volunteer and become active community members. In addition, if you guys come up with creative services or features, I will work to incorporate your ideas into the CCSS! One of my own ideas that I would like to add is something that I call the &ldquo;Hackathon Ladder&rdquo;. I know that many other students in our program feel that hackathons are hard to access or difficult to find, so I want to try and make them more accessible while also incentivizing them with some competition. This Hackathon Ladder program would feature news about upcoming hackathons for all students to see as well as a competitive ladder for teams taking part in hackathons. The teams will be split by year in order to make it more fair. Teams will receive prizes for having the highest participation rate, the most placements and accolades in their hackathons, as well as for having the best hackathon project as chosen by you all!</p><h4 id=3-first-year-liaison>3. First Year Liaison</h4><p>Lastly, I will do my best to convey your feedback to the board by speaking with you at events and meetings. As your representative, I will be able to raise your concerns and help the CCSS become a better place for you all. In order to provide the best possible service to all of you, I&rsquo;ll also make sure to pay attention to any feedback you have for me.</p><p>I believe that by solving these issues, I can be an excellent first year representative. Once again, my name is Hassan Ali, and I wish you all the best!</p></p></div><div id="John Lu" class="position fyr"><h2>John Lu</h2><p><p><img src=/images/first_year_reps/2022/john.png alt=John></p><h3 id=who-am-i-and-what-do-i-want->Who Am I and What do I want? 🙃</h3><p>Hey everyone!

What you should care about is the fact that I have leadership experience from being captain of my school house and of the sports team for two years, and I am interested in running for first year representative of the CCSS.</p><p>I am a very approachable person which is perfect because I will be serving as the medium for first years to voice their concerns to the CCSS. What is the kind of stuff will I do after becoming a first year representative you ask? Here are some examples :</p><ul><li><b>Arrange workshops for students to get familiarized with basic technologies:</b><div>Have you ever felt like your classmates are far ahead of you because they are proficient in software like gitHub, command line, basic programming languages? Workshops like these will help you catch up quickly.</div><br></li><li><b>Make the shift to university more comfortable:</b><div>As an international student going through the shift and culture shock, events like cultural nights can really help students feel at home, no matter if they are international or live close to Ottawa, because everyone misses home.</div><br></li><li><b>Try to get more space for computer science students:</b><div>As some of you who have already attended the fall meeting already know, we do not have enough space with regard to the number of students in computer science.

Such as, finding the perfect tutorial, understanding online instructors or any programming classes. Using the knowledge of the struggles early programmers go through, I have decided to help first-year computer science students to succeed in university and also the future. Even though introduction to Computer Science 1 is supposed to start the basics of coding for inexperienced programmers, I can say that the professors don’t always start from the beginning, leaving some students clueless. </p><h3 id=plans-after-being-elected-as-the-ccss-first-year-representative>Plans After being Elected as the CCSS First Year Representative</h3><h4 id=hosting-workshops-for-new-programmers>Hosting workshops for new programmers</h4><p>One of the best ways to learn coding is practicing every module that is taught. In these workshops the instructors will give fun and interactive projects /activities to participants. Instead of long lectures and getting bombarded with information, these workshops can help the participants to go at their own pace and have fun when programming.
This workshop is also designed for refining or enhancing your skills in programming. You can either work with your peers or any other mentors that are present in this event. You can also get help in any projects or assignments that you are struggling with. This workshop is for any programmers that just need the environment for coding.</p><h4 id=collaborating-in-project-making>Collaborating in Project Making</h4><p>In the computer science industry, experience in programming helps the most when applying for jobs. Companies are looking for how much programming knowledge the candidate has and how to apply it to projects. Therefore, creating this workshop for group projects can help your resume to look stronger.</p><h4 id=helping-with-finding-and-preparing-for-computer-science-field-jobs>Helping with finding and preparing for Computer Science field jobs</h4><p>After making the perfect resume the next step is to prepare for job interviews. Such events that I plan to host can have hiring managers as guests from top companies. They will tell us what they are looking for in an interview, we can then use this knowledge to prepare for them. There can also be upper years which can guide you to success as well.</p><p>All of these events and activities are designed for all levels of coders in Carleton. I am here to help every first year in computer science to succeed.</p></p></div><div id="Ryan Chung" class="position fyr"><h2>Ryan Chung</h2><p><p><img src=/images/first_year_reps/2022/ryan.png alt=Ryan></p><p>Hey!
