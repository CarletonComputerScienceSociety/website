I am an international student that came from Qatar and really looking forward to getting the school year started as the first year rep for the CCSS! I enjoy basketball, football, gaming and anime so dont hesitate to say hi to me if you ever see me around campus. As for why I should be elected for the position:</p><ul><li>I am a social person so bridging the gap between the first years and upper year students is something that comes naturally and I would represent the collective mass of the first year CS students and voice their concerns and opinions.</li><li>I held executive positions at my school for many years so I know how to work from behind the scenes, ranging from planning activities to adjusting the budget to speaking in front of others, assuring that any events organized by me turn out to be great.</li><li>CS is an ever changing field and the CCSS has been a constant point, exisisting for 20+ years. I have a passion for the field of computer science,and using this passion to better the experience of other first year students and representing them would be a great honor.</li></ul><p>Once again I would like to thank you for reading my segment and I implore you to vote for me in the upcoming election.

The aim of these events would be to get first-years involved and connected with CCSS and the larger computer science community at Carleton. The nature of these events would be influenced by the wider first-year body so that the events will appeal to everyone who wants to come out and participate.</p><h3 id=-academic-support-for-ccss-members>üìù Academic support for CCSS members!</h3><p>With the switch back to in-person learning, many are nervous about academics. During the busy and stressful exam seasons, I‚Äôd like to organize study or discussion groups to allow for effective review and give First-Years the opportunity to go over difficult concepts with others who are in the same boat.</p><h3 id=-online-support-for-those-who-want-to-get-involved-remotely>üåê Online support for those who want to get involved remotely!</h3><p>Some First-Year members of the CCSS may be unable to be on campus.

Like all of you, I&rsquo;m a first-year computer science student. After attending the CCSS Fall general meeting and a few of the other amazing events this week, I decided to run for First Year Representative as I believe that I could have a real impact on the Carleton Computer Science Society.</p><p>At the Fall Meeting, there were a few issues that I could address as your First-Year Rep:</p><ol><li>They needed more staff in order to plan more events for the students</li><li>They wanted more volunteers and more ideas</li><li>They wanted a spokesperson for the first years that can convey their sentiments and criticisms to the board of the CCSS</li></ol><h4 id=1-events>1. Events</h4><p>In line with the first point, I would try to organize and plan many more events for the first years. These events may include activities like escape rooms or movie nights, or they may be something more club-related. I know that many students want to join a club but may not know what those clubs do or what they offer even after attending the expo. My plan is to communicate with the various clubs on campus to give a more comprehensive demonstration of what their clubs do as an activity for us first years!</p><h4 id=2-volunteering-and-community-ideas>2. Volunteering and Community Ideas</h4><p>Concerning the second point, I would use surveys and face-to-face discussions to try to help you volunteer and become active community members. In addition, if you guys come up with creative services or features, I will work to incorporate your ideas into the CCSS! One of my own ideas that I would like to add is something that I call the &ldquo;Hackathon Ladder&rdquo;. I know that many other students in our program feel that hackathons are hard to access or difficult to find, so I want to try and make them more accessible while also incentivizing them with some competition. This Hackathon Ladder program would feature news about upcoming hackathons for all students to see as well as a competitive ladder for teams taking part in hackathons. The teams will be split by year in order to make it more fair. Teams will receive prizes for having the highest participation rate, the most placements and accolades in their hackathons, as well as for having the best hackathon project as chosen by you all!</p><h4 id=3-first-year-liaison>3. First Year Liaison</h4><p>Lastly, I will do my best to convey your feedback to the board by speaking with you at events and meetings. As your representative, I will be able to raise your concerns and help the CCSS become a better place for you all. In order to provide the best possible service to all of you, I&rsquo;ll also make sure to pay attention to any feedback you have for me.</p><p>I believe that by solving these issues, I can be an excellent first year representative. Once again, my name is Hassan Ali, and I wish you all the best!</p></p></div><div id="John Lu" class="position fyr"><h2>John Lu</h2><p><p><img src=/images/first_year_reps/2022/john.png alt=John></p><h3 id=who-am-i-and-what-do-i-want->Who Am I and What do I want? üôÉ</h3><p>Hey everyone!

Using the knowledge of the struggles early programmers go through, I have decided to help first-year computer science students to succeed in university and also the future. Even though introduction to Computer Science 1 is supposed to start the basics of coding for inexperienced programmers, I can say that the professors don‚Äôt always start from the beginning, leaving some students clueless.¬†</p><h3 id=plans-after-being-elected-as-the-ccss-first-year-representative>Plans After being Elected as the CCSS First Year Representative</h3><h4 id=hosting-workshops-for-new-programmers>Hosting workshops for new programmers</h4><p>One of the best ways to learn coding is practicing every module that is taught. In these workshops the instructors will give fun and interactive projects /activities to participants. Instead of long lectures and getting bombarded with information, these workshops can help the participants to go at their own pace and have fun when programming.
This workshop is also designed for refining or enhancing your skills in programming. You can either work with your peers or any other mentors that are present in this event. You can also get help in any projects or assignments that you are struggling with. This workshop is for any programmers that just need the environment for coding.</p><h4 id=collaborating-in-project-making>Collaborating in Project Making</h4><p>In the computer science industry, experience in programming helps the most when applying for jobs. Companies are looking for how much programming knowledge the candidate has and how to apply it to projects. Therefore, creating this workshop for group projects can help your resume to look stronger.</p><h4 id=helping-with-finding-and-preparing-for-computer-science-field-jobs>Helping with finding and preparing for Computer Science field jobs</h4><p>After making the perfect resume the next step is to prepare for job interviews. Such events that I plan to host can have hiring managers as guests from top companies. They will tell us what they are looking for in an interview, we can then use this knowledge to prepare for them. There can also be upper years which can guide you to success as well.</p><p>All of these events and activities are designed for all levels of coders in Carleton.
