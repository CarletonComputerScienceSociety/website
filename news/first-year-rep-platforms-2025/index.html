I&rsquo;m especially interested in ensuring that the CCSS is able to host many events where members can learn, practice, and demonstrate programming and other technical skills. Additionally, I want to continue the society&rsquo;s work in collecting and making accessible resources which can help members progress academically and professionally with confidence.</p><p>As a cybersecurity student, I have the right perspective to help the CCSS support and incorporate the new program and its students. I&rsquo;ll be on the lookout for opportunities that allow both B.Cyber and Comp Sci students to dive deeper into their subject matter and develop skills outside of their classes.</p><p>Ultimately, I&rsquo;m excited to foster a community that is not only welcoming to all new students, but also provides ample opportunity to become more engaged and receive support while we work through our first year of study.</p><p>I&rsquo;m always happy to hear suggestions or just chat, so feel free to say hi in person or message me on <strong>Discord, where my username is csilarion.</strong></p></p></div><div id="Alvin Kapoor" class="position fyr"><h2>Alvin Kapoor</h2><p><p><img src=/images/first_year_reps/2025/alvin.jpg alt=Alvin></p><p>First year CS may feel like being thrown into the deep end for a lot a people. You have assignments piling up like Jenga - COMP1405, MATH 1007, COMP1805, etc. and yet you are expected to maintain a social life? Yeah, but no thank you.</p><p>If I&rsquo;m a first-year representative, I want the entire experience to be less about &ldquo;why is this happening to me?&rdquo; and more like, &ldquo;y&rsquo;know what&mldr; It&rsquo;s not too bad&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>My goal is pretty simple: be the best representative for y&rsquo;all and the guy who you can DM when you have a great idea that could make things better!</p><p>Here&rsquo;s my game plan:</p><ul><li><u><strong>Gamified First-Year Engagement:</strong></u> A leaderboard system, that updates every week with points earned from weekly coding challenges, attending events, and participating in hackathons!

In this economy, computer science jobs are hard to come by. Why not get ahead of the crowd and get super valuable advice on your resumes!?</li><li><u><strong>Chill events</strong></u> that aren&rsquo;t just coding 24/7! - Board game nights, movie watch parties, maybe even have a <strong>FIFA World Cup watch party!</strong> (Go Canada!)</li><li><u><strong>I am YOUR representative!</strong></u> You have a grievance?

Starting university can feel overwhelming, from navigating deadlines to understanding co-op and internships, and I want to be the <em>bridge</em> that ensures none of us face these challenges alone.</p><p>One of my first initiatives will be to organize an <strong>open Q&amp;A with upper-year students</strong> who’ve successfully gone through what we’re starting. These sessions will let us ask candid questions about academics, co-op applications, career building, and even personal well-being. Think of it as <em>“Office Hours: Unfiltered”</em>, real stories, real advice.</p><p><em>Also, because I consider all of us to be one big family</em>, at no point do I think I’m in charge! <em>To have your voice heard</em>, I’ll <strong>set up polls for voting, so you choose what happens and which events are held!</strong> Additionally, I’ll keep an <strong>open suggestion form</strong> for ideas you’d like done, and if possible, I’ll make them happen.</p><p>Furthermore, since community is at the heart of my platform, I want us to feel connected as people, beyond academics. I’d work with CCSS to create <strong>casual social events</strong>, game nights, coding challenges, and open drop-ins where friendships are built (because our first year should be full of memories). University is as much about <em>relationships</em> as it is about lectures, and I want to ensure every student finds their place here.</p><p>Another key goal is to make the <strong>co-op and internship process less intimidating</strong>. I’ll connect us with workshops, alumni, and resources on résumés, interviews, and finding roles that match our interests. I also want to spotlight opportunities like <strong>hackathons, coding competitions, and research projects</strong>, places to apply what we learn in class to real-world problems while building our skills and networks.</p><p>In short, if elected, I’ll make our first year not just <em>manageable</em> but <em>meaningful</em>. I’ll be an advocate for clarity in academics and career pathways, a voice for our concerns, and a leader who fosters community and inclusivity.</p><p>Together, we can make this year, one where we not only learn computer science but also discover how strong we can be as a community ❤ ️.</p><hr></p></div><div id="Jack Gibbons" class="position fyr"><h2>Jack Gibbons</h2><p><p><img src=/images/first_year_reps/2025/jack.jpg alt=Jack></p><h3 id=-who-am-ihttpsdrivegooglecomfiled1tao9zcaijnscxq8p9fyl6j938fyfmmq7view><a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TaO9ZCaIJNsCXq8p9FYL6J938fYfMmQ7/view>🙋 Who am I?</a></h3><p>Hey! I’m Jack, a first-year Computer Science student in the Cybersecurity stream running to be
your representative. To be brief, my goal is to make our first year more <strong>connected</strong> by creating
opportunities to meet new people, build friendships, and support each other academically. I want
to foster a <strong>community</strong> where students feel included, engaged, and able to grow together.</p><p>Below are some highlights from my platform. If you want a more detailed copy, please reference

activities such as laser tag and capture the flag. These events will give students the chance to
<strong>connect</strong> outside of class, form friendships, and make the transition to university life easier. A
stronger community also leads to stronger academics, since it’s easier to study together, share
resources, and <strong>collaborate</strong> with each other.</p><h3 id=-academic-supporthttpsdrivegooglecomfiled1tao9zcaijnscxq8p9fyl6j938fyfmmq7view><a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TaO9ZCaIJNsCXq8p9FYL6J938fYfMmQ7/view>💦🌱 Academic Support</a></h3><p>Instead of solely relying on <strong>mentorship</strong> from upper years, my goal is to move towards a more
accessible peer support-based system. This includes creating a first-year <strong>tutoring</strong> system
where students who are confident in certain subjects can volunteer to help others, forming
regular <strong>study groups</strong>, as well as organizing drop-in study sessions before midterms and
exams. I also want to connect students with existing <strong>resources</strong> such as academic advisors, TA
office hours, and online communities.</p><h3 id=-networkinghttpsdrivegooglecomfiled1tao9zcaijnscxq8p9fyl6j938fyfmmq7view><a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TaO9ZCaIJNsCXq8p9FYL6J938fYfMmQ7/view>🕸️ Networking</a></h3><p>Building <strong>connections</strong> is as important as personal connections. Putting your foot in the door as
early as possible is a strong step to take towards building your <strong>career</strong>. I will organize events
that <strong>professionally</strong> connect us with alumni and industry professionals. The events will include
alumni panels, workshops, and resume clinics.</p><h3 id=-pledge-to-actionhttpsdrivegooglecomfiled1tao9zcaijnscxq8p9fyl6j938fyfmmq7view><a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TaO9ZCaIJNsCXq8p9FYL6J938fYfMmQ7/view>✊ Pledge to Action</a></h3><p>As your representative, I pledge to listen to your ideas and bring forth an <strong>ever-adapting</strong> plan of

My goal is to connect as many first-year students to upper-year students who are in computer science as well. Another event is having a meet and greet with CS professors. This would not only make you have a deeper connection with your professor but could also benefit you in the long run, like in research projects or in becoming a teaching assistant (TA).</p><h3 id=women-in-cs>Women in CS</h3><p>Moreover, as a woman, I understand how male-dominated the CS field is. With that in mind, some activities that I would make to foster a good, encouraging, environment for women in STEM include having a panel for women where profs and industry women share their journeys with everyone. As well as have a fun Q&amp;A + snacks in order to get useful tips and advice. I’m committed to ensuring that women’s voices are heard and acknowledged through the various opportunities that would take place.</p><h3 id=co-op-support>Co-op Support</h3><p>Furthermore, Co-op is another huge step in your life. I know how confusing and frustrating it could sound. Where do you start? Where do you look? How to get prepared? All of these questions would guarantee an answer through attending my meetups where you could further expand your communication and networking skills.</p><h3 id=excited-to-meet-everyone>Excited to Meet Everyone!</h3><p>I will always be more than happy to hear from you! Whether it’s suggestions for events, seeking connections, or if you simply just want someone that shares your interests in CS!</p><p>We, as first-year’s CS students, will rock this year and all the years to come!</p><h3 id=-votesofia4fyr-httpswwwinstagramcomvotesofia4fyr><a href=https://www.instagram.com/votesofia4fyr/>🥳 VoteSofia4FYR 🥳</a></h3><p>Insta: votesofia4fyr</p></p></div><div id="Stephen Sun" class="position fyr"><h2>Stephen Sun</h2><p><p><img src=/images/first_year_reps/2025/stephen.jpg alt=Stephen></p><p>Hi, I’m Stephen.</p><p>As your representative, I will help organize events featuring math-based coding challenges. These will be similar to Math Olympiad questions but less difficult, making them very interesting for anyone who enjoys coding and mathematics.</p><h3 id=introducing-you-to-coding-challenges>Introducing you to Coding Challenges</h3><p>If you are familiar with LeetCode, you can expect questions in a similar style. I also draw inspiration from platforms like Codeforces and AtCoder, which tend to be more math-heavy. LeetCode is known for technical interview preparation, whereas these other platforms are better for developing strong mathematical problem-solving skills. Below are some links to example problems. Take a look to see if you enjoy them! (Note: These can be very hard for beginners, but problems are ranked by difficulty.)</p><ol><li><a href=https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2148/A>Problem - 2148A - Codeforces</a><br><a href=https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/146112>Solution: Codeforces Round 1050 (Div. 4) Editorial - Codeforces</a></li><li><a href=https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2139/B>Problem - 2139B - Codeforces</a><br><a href=https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/146172>Solution: Codeforces Round 1048 (Div. 1, Div. 2) Editorial - Codeforces</a></li><li><a href=https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/>Climbing Stairs - LeetCode</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0lT9Fck7qI">Solution: Climbing Stairs - Dynamic Programming - Leetcode 70 - Python</a></li></ol><h3 id=why-this-is-important-for-you>Why This is Important For You</h3><p>This type of coding challenge is often called competitive programming.
