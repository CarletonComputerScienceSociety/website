It’s important to build a solid foundation in programming, and rushing through the introductory material before you’re ready can lead to a worse experience down the road. Struggling in 1405Z will seriously impact your confidence, your CGPA, and your enjoyment of the program.</p><p>If you want to know whether you would likely succeed in COMP 1405 Z, read through the learning outcomes on the <a href=https://outline.scs.carleton.ca/media/2023/F/COMP1405ZF2023/COMP-1405-Z-F-2023.pdf>course syllabus</a> and compare them to what you’ve done previously in high school and on your own time.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>The course syllabus linked is from the <strong>Fall 2023 term</strong> and may NOT reflect the exact content of the course in future terms.</em></p><div style=height:.1rem></div><style>ul{list-style:none}</style><h4 id=comp-1405-z--learning-outcomes>COMP 1405 Z – Learning Outcomes</h4><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Can you explain and use the following programming concepts in your code?<ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Data types and variables</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Propositional logic and Boolean expressions</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Conditional statements like <code>if</code> and <code>else</code></li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Loops such as <code>for</code> and <code>while</code>, including nested loops</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Lists (1D and 2D) and collections like dictionaries</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Functions and recursion</li></ul></li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Can you implement basic searching (e.g., linear search) and sorting (e.g., selection sort) algorithms?</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Do you understand the basics of runtime and memory complexity?</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Can you discuss trade-offs between different algorithmic approaches?</li></ul><h4 id=comp-1406-z--learning-outcomes>COMP 1406 Z – Learning Outcomes</h4><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Can you write Java programs that follow the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm?</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Do you understand and apply the core OOP principles?<ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Encapsulation</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Abstraction</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Inheritance</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Polymorphism</li></ul></li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Can you describe how memory is managed in a Java program?</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Are you able to solve problems using recursion?</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Can you use abstract data types (like stacks, queues, or lists) to solve problems?</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Do you know how to use exception handling to write programs that handle errors gracefully?</li></ul><div style=height:.1rem></div><p>While reading over the learning outcomes, ask yourself: do you understand <strong>most or all</strong> of the concepts?

Most courses under COMP, MATH, or STAT should be considered heavy as they tend to have large assignments or weekly tutorials that take up a lot of time.</p><p>During 2nd year, most students try to complete all the required 2000-level courses in a single year to unlock all the available 3000-level COMP courses options.</p><p>In first-year, you&rsquo;ll typically take 2 to 3 demanding courses per term—but in second year, that often jumps to 3 or 4 heavy courses each semester, which can quickly lead to burnout and make it harder to fully absorb the material.</p><p>By shifting some 2000-level courses earlier, you can lighten your second-year workload. However, this comes at the consequence of making your first-year workload heavier.</p><br><h3 id=recommended-course-load-without-z-section>Recommended Course Load Without Z-Section</h3><p>In this layout, you will notice that the fall term of your 2nd year has <strong>four heavy courses</strong>. This is the a common course load for students who do not take the Z-section and do not take any 2000-level COMP courses in their first year.</p><p><strong>Fall Term 1st Year 🟢</strong></p><ul style=list-style:disc><li>COMP 1405</li><li>MATH 1007</li><li>Elective</li><li>Elective</li><li>Elective</li></ul><p><strong>Winter Term 1st Year 🟡</strong></p><ul style=list-style:disc><li>COMP 1406</li><li>COMP 1805</li><li>MATH 1104</li><li>Elective</li><li>Elective</li></ul><p><strong>Fall Term 2nd Year 🔴</strong></p><ul style=list-style:disc><li>COMP 2401</li><li>COMP 2402</li><li>COMP 2406</li><li>STAT 2507</li><li>Elective</li></ul><p><strong>Winter Term 2nd Year 🟡</strong></p><ul style=list-style:disc><li>COMP 2404</li><li>COMP 2804</li><li>2000+ Level MATH</li><li>Elective</li><li>Elective</li></ul><br><h3 id=recommended-course-load-with-z-section>Recommended Course Load With Z-Section</h3><p>In this layout, you will notice that every term has <strong>three heavy courses</strong>. This is a perfectly balanced course load, however it comes with the cost of having a heavier first year instead of a heavier second year.</p><p><strong>Fall Term 1st Year 🟡</strong></p><ul style=list-style:disc><li>COMP 1405</li><li>COMP 1406</li><li>MATH 1007</li><li>Elective</li><li>Elective</li></ul><p><strong>Winter Term 1st Year 🟡</strong></p><ul style=list-style:disc><li>MATH 1104</li><li>COMP 1805</li><li>COMP 2401</li><li>Elective</li><li>Elective</li></ul><p><strong>Fall Term 2nd Year 🟡</strong></p><ul style=list-style:disc><li>COMP 2402</li><li>COMP 2406</li><li>STAT 2507</li><li>Elective</li><li>Elective</li></ul><p><strong>Winter Term 2nd Year 🟡</strong></p><ul style=list-style:disc><li>COMP 2404</li><li>COMP 2804</li><li>2000+ Level MATH</li><li>Elective</li><li>Elective</li></ul><p>You now have four perfectly balanced terms of <strong>three heavy courses each</strong>.</p><br><h2 id=are-there-other-ways-i-can-lessen-2nd-year-course-load>Are There Other Ways I Can Lessen 2nd Year Course Load?</h2><p>Yes. There are other ways.</p><p>While taking COMP 2000-level courses early is the most direct method and comes with the added advantage of enabling you to learn job related skills earlier, there are other strategic ways to balance your course load and reduce the pressure of second year without overloading your first-year schedule.</p><br><h3 id=1-take-a-2000-level-comp-course-in-the-summer>1. Take a 2000-Level COMP Course in the Summer</h3><p>COMP 2401 and COMP 2402 have now been offered in the summer for the past few years. If you were to take any 2000-level COMP course during the summer of your first year, you could reduce the number of “heavy courses” you need to take in your second year fall term from four to three.</p><br><h3 id=2-take-stat-2507-in-first-year>2. Take STAT 2507 in First Year</h3><p>Taking STAT 2507 in first year reduces one of the required courses you’ll otherwise likely want to take in second year.</p><p>By taking it in the Fall Term of your first year, you will end up with four perfectly balanced terms of “heavy” courses. This is the simplest way to logically lessen your 2nd year course load.</p><br><h3 id=3-take-math-2000-credit-in-first-year>3. Take MATH 2000+ Credit in First Year</h3><p>As early as winter of first-year, you can take a MATH 2000+ level course, which is a requirement of your major.</p><p>However, by default you will have likely placed one of each of your 1000 level math requirements in each term to spread them out.</p><p>This means if you blindly throw a MATH 2000+ course into your Winter Term, you will likely now have four heavy courses in the Winter Term of your first year.</p><p>If you plan to do this, you should also move either your opposite MATH 1000 level requirement or COMP 1805 requirement to the fall to maintain having three perfectly balanced course loads.</p><br><h3 id=4-push-a-2000-level-course-to-third-year>4. Push a 2000-Level Course to Third Year</h3><p>Instead of pushing courses earlier, you can also push them back further.</p><p>Courses like STAT 2507, or your 2000 level MATH credit do not impact you gaining access to 3000 level COMP courses.</p><p>You also are not going to take all your 3000 COMP courses in third year. So you do not need to complete all the necessary 2000 level prerequisites right away.</p><br><h3 id=5-taking-comp-1805-in-first-year-fall-doesnt-necessarily-lessen-2nd-year-course-load>5. Taking COMP 1805 in First-Year Fall Doesn’t Necessarily Lessen 2nd Year Course Load</h3><p>Taking COMP 1805 in first year fall does not really lessen your 2nd year course load unless you anticipate taking COMP 2804 in the winter of your 1st year.</p><p>We recommend you <strong>do not</strong> take COMP 2804 before taking STAT 2507. Taking STAT 2507 before COMP 2804 makes the course experience easier because there is overlap between their material.</p><p>If you just move COMP 1805 to the fall term of your first year, you’ll just end up with 3 “heavy courses” in the fall and 2 “heavy courses” in the winter.</p><br><h2 id=benefits-of-reducing-your-2nd-year-course-load>Benefits of Reducing Your 2nd Year Course Load</h2><div style=height:.1rem></div><h3 id=1-better-prepared-for-co-op-or-internships>1. Better Prepared for Co-op or Internships</h3><p>Most students begin seriously preparing for internships and co-op placements in their second year, as that’s when co-op becomes available. Having extra time in your schedule means more opportunity to:</p><ul style=list-style:disc><li>Work on personal projects that strengthen your resume</li><li>Research and apply to jobs earlier</li><li>Prepare for technical interviews</li><li>Attend networking events, info sessions, or career fairs</li><li>Get feedback on your resume and cover letters</li></ul><p>In contrast, students who are overwhelmed by the number of assignments in their heavy second-year course load often don’t have the time or energy to properly prepare—despite this being the most critical time to do so.</p><br><h3 id=2-improved-grades-and-wellbeing>2. Improved Grades and Wellbeing</h3><p>When you’re juggling too many demanding courses at once, it becomes harder to perform well in any of them. By spreading your required courses more evenly, you give yourself space to:</p><ul style=list-style:disc><li>Spend more time understanding difficult concepts</li><li>Start projects and assignments earlier</li><li>Avoid burnout and maintain a healthier academic routine</li></ul><p>This often results in stronger grades and a more sustainable university experience.</p><br><h3 id=3-more-flexibility-in-upper-years>3. More Flexibility in Upper Years</h3><p>Finishing some required courses early can unlock more 3000-level COMP courses ahead of schedule giving you access to more scheduling options.</p><br><h2 id=why-shifting-courses-to-your-1st-year-could-be-a-bad-idea>Why Shifting Courses to Your 1st Year Could Be a Bad Idea</h2><p>While there are clear advantages to lightening your second year, it’s important not to underestimate the adjustment period of the first year.</p><p>You’re entering a brand-new environment and taking on too much too quickly can make it harder to adapt.</p><p>Having a lighter first-year schedule gives you time to:</p><ul style=list-style:disc><li>Attend campus events and club meetings</li><li>Make friends and build a social network</li><li>Get used to university-level studying and time management</li><li>Explore your interests and other domains of study</li><li>Ease into the higher expectations of post-secondary life</li></ul><p>The reality is: most first-year students benefit from a slower start. You’ll have plenty of time in future years to push yourself academically. Don’t burn yourself out before you even find your footing.</p><br><h2 id=which-2000-level-comp-course-should-i-take>Which 2000-Level COMP Course Should I Take?</h2><p>The best options to take early are <strong>COMP 2401</strong> or <strong>COMP 2402</strong>, as both serve as prerequisites for a large number of proceeding courses. Taking either of these in your first year will give you more flexibility and more course registration options in second year.</p><div style=height:.25rem></div><p><strong>COMP 2401 (Introduction to Systems Programming)</strong> is a prerequisite for:</p><ul><li>COMP 2404 (Introduction to Software Engineering)</li><li>COMP 3000 (Operating Systems)</li></ul><div style=height:.25rem></div><p><strong>COMP 2402 (Abstract Data Types and Algorithms)</strong> is a prerequisite for:</p><ul><li>COMP 3000 (Operating Systems)</li><li>COMP 3005 (Database Management Systems)</li><li>COMP 3007 (Programming Paradigms)</li></ul><div style=height:.25rem></div><p>If you haven’t taken COMP 1805 in the fall (which is required before taking COMP 2804), then your only other real option is <strong>COMP 2406 (Fundamentals of Web Applications)</strong>. While COMP 2406 does teach valuable, practical skills that can be leveraged for industry jobs, it doesn’t unlock any new courses by itself. It’s a prerequisite for COMP 3004, but COMP 3004 also requires COMP 2404, which you can’t take without first completing COMP 2401.</p></div><hr class=resource__separator><div style=height:.5rem></div><div class=resource__contributors><span><i class="far fa-user" aria-hidden=true></i></span>
