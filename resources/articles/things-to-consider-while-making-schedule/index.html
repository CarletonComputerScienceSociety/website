June 20, 2025</div><hr class=resource__separator style=margin-bottom:-.7rem><div class=article-question__body><h3 id=consider-all-the-possibilities>Consider all the Possibilities</h3><p>When you are initially building your schedule, you might find it helpful to <strong>start by adding in all possible sections</strong> of your mandatory classes, and do the same for any elective classes you absolutely want to take.</p><p>While this may look a little scary at first, you will have a visual representation of classes that may cause timing conflicts in your schedule - which makes planning your classes a bit easier.</p><p>If you are going into your first year, classes that you will (likely) need to add are:</p><ul><li>COMP 1405</li><li>COMP 1406</li><li>COMP 1805</li><li>MATH 1007</li><li>MATH 1104</li></ul><p>You can visit <a href=https://carleton.ca/registration/course-selection-guide/bcs/>this</a> SCS page to view suggested course sequences for first-year students, if you’re curious about when students typically take the courses mentioned above.</p><br><h3 id=class-timing>Class Timing</h3><p>An important thing to consider when planning your schedule is class timing, as it can impact your class attendance, or how successful you are in the course.</p><p><strong>Are you a morning person?</strong> If yes, maybe you want to consider taking early morning classes to free up the rest of your day.</p><p><strong>Are you a night owl who wakes up late?</strong> If this is the case, maybe willingly adding an 8:30 am class into your scheduling is a bad idea.</p><p>Do you <strong>have obligations during the evening, or just like hanging out at night?</strong> If so, you might want to consider taking classes earlier in the day, or taking “unscheduled” courses that are flexible as to when classwork needs to be completed.</p><p>If you’re a <strong>commuter student</strong> - you might want to consider trying to <strong>limit your in-person classes to certain days</strong>, in order to save you some travel time.</p><br><h3 id=lunch-time>Lunch Time</h3><p>When adding classes, you may be tempted to add all of your classes consecutively to consolidate your classes to two or three days of your schedule.</p><p>While you might think you’ll be okay - consider planning a gap in your schedule in order to <strong>have time to eat your lunch.</strong> It likely won’t be possible to align it to a certain time frame, but having time to refuel in order to be able to focus in class is critical!</p><br><h3 id=other-factors-outside-of-timing-to-consider>Other Factors (Outside of Timing) to Consider</h3><p>Outside of class timing, there are a couple of other factors that you should take into consideration when planning your classes.</p><p>Here are some guiding questions:</p><ul><li>What kind of course is it? Is it a mandatory class? Is it a prerequisite for other classes?</li><li>Is it online-friendly? Are there live lectures or is it unscheduled?</li><li>Do you need to sprint across campus between blocks?</li></ul><br><h3 id=time-ticket-madness>Time-Ticket Madness</h3><p>If you are not one of the lucky few to have an early registration <a href=https://carleton.ca/registration/dates/timetickets/>time ticket</a>, the initial schedule that you made may not work out, as <strong>some classes may fill up before your time ticket.</strong> In order to prevent this being an issue for you - you can do a couple of things to prepare.</p><p>First off, before your time ticket, you can <strong>create multiple different versions of your schedule</strong> with different sections of the same classes. However, this isn’t fail-proof, and one of the classes that you were interested in taking might be entirely full. Since there is always a probability of this happening, be prepared to revise your schedule right before your timeslot, in order to not have to rush to adjust courses when it opens.</p><p>If there is a course that you have your heart set on, but it fills up before you’re able to register - you might be able to join a <a href=https://carleton.ca/registration/waitlisting/>waitlist</a> for the course. Oftentimes, a couple of students will drop any given course, meaning that there is a chance that you’d be able to register in it closer to/during the term.</p><br><h3 id=rate-my-prof>Rate My Prof</h3><p>While you may be tempted to solely base your professor choices on their RateMyProf ratings - it is best to <strong>take them with a grain of salt.</strong> However, if most of the reviews are positive - then the rating is more likely to be credible, as negative reviews are sometimes written in reaction to getting a bad grade in the class (which can be a result of lack of engagement in the course on the student’s part).</p><p>If you are seeking to get insight on which professor you might want to choose, you can <strong>ask upper year students for advice!</strong></p><p>You can also check out <a href=https://outline.scs.carleton.ca/>past course outlines</a> to see how specific instructors have strucutured their course in the past.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Course outlines can change each year. Use past outlines as a reference only, and don’t rely on them as a guarantee of what the course will be like this year.</em></p><br><h3 id=no-schedule-is-perfect>No Schedule is Perfect</h3><p>Even if your schedule doesn’t turn out perfectly - whether due to factors beyond your control or decisions you later wish you’d made differently - it’s not the end of the world. Take note of what didn’t work and use that insight to improve your planning the next time course registration comes around.</p><p>If you ever want to make changes to your courses down the line, <strong>you are able to drop and add courses until the respective deadlines</strong>, which you can find in the <a href=https://students.carleton.ca/academic-dates/>Academic Calendar</a>.</p></div><hr class=resource__separator><div style=height:.5rem></div><div class=resource__contributors><span><i class="far fa-user" aria-hidden=true></i></span>
