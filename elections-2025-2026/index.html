I’m Veronica, the current president and previous first-year representative, and I am running with hopes of being re-elected as CCSS president for the coming year!</p><p>If I am re-elected, the following is what I would hope to accomplish during my term:</p><h3 id=ensuring-proper-use-of-levy-funds>Ensuring Proper Use of Levy Funds</h3><p>Throughout the past couple of years, we have been vouching for the establishment of a levy fee of $2.50/term for full-time students - in hopes of maintaining the operational baseline that the CCSS maintains.</p><p>As I served as the Chair of the YES committee, and helped ensure that the levy referendum passed last year - I am highly committed to ensuring that the money that we receive from students benefits you the most.</p><p>As this year is the first year that this is going to be in place - it is essential that a proper basis is set, making sure that the funds are spent sustainably in the future.</p><h3 id=increasing-development-opportunities>Increasing Development Opportunities</h3><p>Because of the effects of the recent pandemic on the community, there are fewer opportunities to build projects and get development experience.</p><p>What I plan to do to improve this:</p><ul><li>Day-long development sprint events - as not everyone has the opportunity to commit to a multi-day hackathon, I suggest that we offer opportunities for students to create mini-projects within the span of a day. This gives students the benefit of learning alongside others in a non-academic setting, as well as the opportunity to meet peers that they might not otherwise.</li><li>Month-long development events - since hackathons don’t really let you build something very robust because of time constraints, offering students an event where we give a prompt and give students a month to create a project based on the prompt will offer a different experience.</li></ul><h3 id=increasing-accessibility>Increasing Accessibility</h3><p>Everyone has instances where they might want to go to a certain event, but they might not be able to make it because of timing constraints, or maybe they cannot make it to campus for that particular time.</p><p>What I suggest we do about this:</p><ul><li>Hybrid approach to events - when possible, we offer an option to tune in online via Zoom or some other platform.</li><li>Recording events - if we are offering an online/hybrid option for an event, this also opens the opportunity to record events through that platform</li><li>Online events - during the pandemic, there were online events offered, as on-campus events were not possible. I suggest that we bring back some of these events, such as speed-friending!</li></ul><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read this far, and I hope you have a lovely rest of your term!</p><p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at <a href=mailto:veronica.mordvinova@ccss.carleton.ca>veronica.mordvinova@ccss.carleton.ca</a> :)</p></p><hr></div></div><div class=operations-candidates><div class="position operations"><h2 id=kimia>Kimia Khorram-Roudi - Director of Operations</h2><p><p>Hello! My name is Kimia and I am running in the CCSS General Election for the position of Director of Operations. I have frequently volunteered with the CCSS over the past few months and would be delighted to continue to do so and to have a greater impact and role in the society in order to further continue the efforts the CCSS puts to help represent all undergraduate computer science students. I am passionate about helping out as well as passionate about the community here at Carleton. Even if I am not elected, I wish to continue to help make the CCSS and the community an inviting and pleasant place for everyone.</p><p>If elected as your Director of Operations, my focus will be on ensuring all events and initiatives run smoothly and that they are as accessible as possible for all computer science students, this is said in consideration of students living on and off campus. Constant planning and thought of all logistics are just some things that help an event run smoothly and successfully. Another thing I would focus on is volunteers and how they can get involved, creating more opportunities for people of all levels with various interests being brought into consideration. Having opportunities of various styles and considerations will help many different people find something they can do and to earn more experience as well as be able to be a part of the CCSS in a way that is comfortable for them. I will focus on both internal and external operations for the CCSS.</p><p>If elected, I will ensure that there will be many different events run that would cater to a wide range of students and that they would continue to be enjoyable and memorable for everyone who attends or takes part in them. I will also seek out input from the community and see what the majority of people would look forward to and would be interested in seeing the CCSS do. With this strategy, the CCSS would run events that students would like to see and that students would be heard. I would achieve this by conducting votes in order to see interests as well as occasionally ask for input from the general public such as for ideas or what they liked in previous events. These would be done both in person and online in order to make it more accessible.</p><p>Thank you for your consideration and for reading this far! If you have any questions whatsoever, feel free to contact me on Discord (Username: ajmr1). I am always happy to hear from other people in the community!</p></p><hr></div></div><div class=finance-candidates><div class="position finance"><h2 id=cameron>Cameron Stirrup - Director of Finance</h2><p><p>Hey everyone!

Peer-Led Study Groups 🧠</h3><ul><li>Host study groups with experienced students for any course in demand—swapping ideas, prepping for exams.</li><li>From first-year hurdles to upper-year challenges, I’ll connect you with peers who’ve been there.</li></ul><h3 id=3-career-boost-for-all->3. Career Boost for All 🚀</h3><ul><li>Launch a peer mentorship program pairing upper-years with lower-years for resume tweaks, interview practice, project advice.</li><li>Host skills workshops on tools (e.g., Python, Git) and job-prep essentials (e.g., interviews, portfolios) for all levels.</li><li>Build a “CS Toolkit” with project ideas, certs, and co-op tips to help you shine, whatever your year.</li></ul><h3 id=4-always-there-for-you->4. Always There for You 🤝</h3><ul><li>Run regular study sessions (like my finals one on my floor).</li><li>Be your go-to at the lounge (I volunteer there—say hi when you see me!) or online—anytime you need help.</li></ul><h3 id=about-me>About Me</h3><p>I’m a first-year CS student, active with CCSS events and lounge volunteering. I’ve hosted a study session on my floor and helped classmates in person and online. Grades and routines drive me, and I’ll bring that focus here. I’m not alone—YOUR ideas fuel this.

My previous <strong>leadership experience</strong> has given me the skills to plan events, bring people together, and create an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome.</p><h3 id=why-am-i-running->Why Am I Running? 🎉</h3><p>The CCSS plays a crucial role in fostering a <strong>fun and supportive environment</strong> for computer science students. University life can be stressful, and I want to ensure that students have <strong>opportunities to connect, relax, and build meaningful friendships</strong> outside of academics. Whether you&rsquo;re a first-year looking to meet new people or a senior hoping to engage more with the community, I want to create events that cater to everyone.</p><h3 id=my-goals-as-director-of-social->My Goals as Director of Social 🏆</h3><p>If elected, I will focus on:</p><p>✔ <strong>Hosting a variety of social events</strong> – From game nights and themed gatherings to larger networking socials, I want to create diverse opportunities for students to connect.</p><p>✔ <strong>Building a welcoming and inclusive community</strong> – Ensuring all students, regardless of background or experience, feel comfortable and encouraged to participate.</p><p>✔ <strong>Enhancing student engagement</strong> – Gathering feedback to plan events that truly reflect students&rsquo; interests and working with the Director of Publications making sure they are well-promoted so no one misses out.</p><p>✔ <strong>Collaborating with other directors</strong> – Incorporating social elements into academic and career-related events to make them more interactive and enjoyable.</p><h3 id=lets-build-a-stronger-cs-community->Let’s Build a Stronger CS Community! 💪</h3><p>I am passionate about making the Computer Science Society feel like a close-knit and welcoming group.

I would love your support in making this vision a reality!</p><p><strong>⭐ Vote Amanjot for Director of Social! ⭐</strong></p></p><hr></div><div class="position social"><h2 id=riley>Riley Lutz - Director of Social</h2><p><p>Hey everyone!
My name is Riley Lutz, and I’m excited to announce my candidacy for Director of Social for the 2025-2026 academic year.</p><p>I know that social interaction plays a vital role in our academic success and well-being. Whether it’s collaborating on that one vexing group project, networking for our career, or just doing a bit of trolling in the CCSS lounge, staying connected with peers is part of what makes our CS journey worth experiencing.</p><p>My goal as Director of Social is to create engaging events that help students build friendships, develop communication skills, and make lasting memories - all while fostering a strong sense of community within our club. Here’s some ways I plan to make this happen:</p><h3 id=competitive-team-activities->Competitive Team Activities 🏅</h3><p>One of the best ways to learn and grow in computer science is through a little friendly competition! I plan to organize team-based events that challenge participants while keeping things fun and engaging. Some ideas include coding tug of war matches, capture the flag games, and relay-based coding races! These&rsquo;ll give us a chance to sharpen up our skills while engaging in a tad of friendly rivalry!</p><h3 id=social-mixers->Social Mixers 👋</h3><p>It can be easy to catch a case of tunnel vision when on the course grind, so I want to create welcoming spaces where you can meet professors, upper-years, and those in your own year in a relaxed setting. Some examples of this would be Icebreaker activities, &ldquo;ask me anything&rdquo; panels, and speed friending, not to mention first-year oriented events!</p><h3 id=gaming-tournaments--socials->Gaming Tournaments & Socials 🕹️</h3><p>Gaming is something many of us just don&rsquo;t get tired of, and I want to make sure that we continue to host events that let students lock in and show what they&rsquo;re made of! If elected, I will do my best to cater to both the casual and competitive gaming audience, via party game nights (Jackbox, Smash Brothers, draw.io), structured tourneys(Valorant, Marvel Rivals, Overwatch) and more!</p><h3 id=outdoor--physical-activities->Outdoor / Physical Activities 🤸</h3><p>Us computer scientists have to unstick ourselves from those screens at some point, so as Director of Social I would put an emphasis on events allowing us to touch a bit of grass and get back in touch with nature! To start off, I feel like students often don&rsquo;t feel incentivised to explore Ottawa&rsquo;s paths and trails, so some hikes and trail walks would be something I would put together throughout the year. Organizing recreational sports matches, ice skating, swimming, and group gym workouts to get the blood pumping are some other ideas I&rsquo;d put into practice in this position.</p><p>As Director of Social, my priority would be to make our club a place where everyone feels welcome, engaged and involved in our community. I want to hear your thoughts as well - this club is for all of us, after all! I aim to maintain an open-door policy and keep my ear close to the ground for the next big idea, so please don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out!</p></p><hr></div></div><div class=industry-candidates><div class="position industry"><h2 id=eros>Eros "Patrick" McGuire - Director of Industry Initiatives</h2><p><p>Hello everyone, my name is Eros and I&rsquo;m looking to be your 2025-2026 Director of Industry Initiatives. With our new student levy in place for the upcoming term we as a society are ready to take things to the next level.</p><p>Why should you vote for me? Well let me share with you what I want to accomplish as the Director of Industry Initiatives.</p><h3 id=laying-the-foundation-for-the-future>Laying the foundation for the future</h3><p>As Industry Initiatives Director, I will lay the foundation for long-term success by creating essential resources that future directors can build upon. This includes a comprehensive database to track company partnerships, a strategic playbook to guide outreach and relationship-building, and other key tools to streamline industry engagement. With these resources, we can secure stronger partnerships, increase funding for major events, and create lasting connections between students and industry leaders ensuring our society continues to thrive for years to come.</p><h3 id=sponsored-events>Sponsored Events</h3><p>Our society represents one of the largest communities of computer science students across all of Ontario. By partnering with us, recruiters gain direct access to top-tier talent. Industry leaders who will drive innovation in their fields. This unique opportunity allows organizations to connect with exceptional candidates while supporting our flagship events, such as Week of Awesome and Hack the Tunnels. With their financial support, we can take these events to new heights, creating even more impactful experiences for students and recruiters alike.</p><h3 id=networking-events>Networking Events</h3><p>Finding a job, whether it’s for co-op or after graduation, is one of the biggest challenges CS students face. One of the best ways to land opportunities is through networking with recruiters, but many students don’t get enough chances to do so. That’s why I want to organize more networking events with top companies, giving you better access to industry professionals, career insights, and potential job opportunities.</p><p>I’m excited for the chance to serve you as the Director of Industry Initiatives and to work with students and companies alike to provide the best possible opportunities for you and your future.
If you have any questions about my platform or have any questions for me you can contact me via discord, email, or find me in the CCSS lounge most days.</p><p>Email: <a href=mailto:patrickmcguire3@cmail.carleton.ca>patrickmcguire3@cmail.carleton.ca</a></p><p>Discord: ep0x_</p></p><hr></div></div><div class=publications-candidates><div class="position publications"><h2 id=landon>Landon MacDonald - Director of Publications</h2><p><h3 id=new-and-improved-resources>New and Improved Resources:</h3><p>In my opinion, the website has room for additional resources for:</p><ul><li><strong>How to study for and where to find study material for courses</strong> that are often challenging. Often, in some of the harder second-year courses students may feel a little stuck. Instead of waiting for study session events to run on their specific course, this would be a permanent resource to help them get back on track.</li><li><strong>Getting and preparing for internships.</strong> One of the FAQs I see all the time is “How do I get my first internship?” or “How do I prepare for an Interview?” and while we do run events specifically addressing these questions, having a dedicated page to answer your questions when you need it is nothing but a bonus.</li><li><strong>How to get involved in open-source.</strong> Other than all the amazing benefits of open-source projects they are also an amazing spot for people to get started with development experience as there is no barrier to entry; There is no time wasted wondering what project to do; And there is something to do for any skill level.</li></ul><p>I would take the lead on getting these resources available to students, and with the help of volunteers looking for development experience, it would be well maintained as well as knowledge transferred to future years.</p><h3 id=email-system>Email System:</h3><p>There has been talk about getting an email system running in the past for one reason or another it has been pushed to the wayside. Over the summer I plan on getting an email system laid out to support:</p><ul><li><strong>Weekly (or biweekly) emails</strong> sent out informing everyone “What is Going on with CCSS Next Week”. This creates another channel for people to learn about upcoming events which goes directly into their Carleton inbox to boost attendance at events.</li><li><strong>Email lists reminding everyone about events</strong> they have signed up for, lowering our no-show rate on some free-to-sign-up events.</li><li><strong>A Volunteer Email list,</strong> although we already have a volunteer email list its upkeep has been almost non-existent. I plan to incorporate it into this email system allowing for easier upkeep.</li></ul><h3 id=blog-posts>Blog Posts:</h3><p>On the CCSS website, there is a blog section which is extremely infrequently updated (currently once every 2 years). This section of our site has a lot of potential to act like a time capsule where all the info from an event can be condensed and preserved for future years.</p><h3 id=how-could-volunteers-help-with-the-above>How Could Volunteers Help With the Above?</h3><p>Both the email system and the blog posts are the type of project that need continued support and while I will be doing my best to make sure they are the best they can be, every bit of help makes it even better. Throughout the school year we would be needing people to write and edit both blog posts and “What is Going on with CCSS Next Week” emails.</p><p>Some small changes to the website would also be needed to reflect the new email system (adding somewhere to sign up and updating the volunteer email list info), this would open the door for some volunteers to get started with web development.</p></p><hr></div></div></div></div><noscript><img src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/pixel.gif></noscript><script defer src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/script.js></script></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:info@ccss.carleton.ca>info@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
