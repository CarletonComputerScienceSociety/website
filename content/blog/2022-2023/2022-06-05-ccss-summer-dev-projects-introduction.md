# CCSS Summer Dev Projects

## Introductions

### Forest Anderson ([@AngelOnFira](https://github.com/angelonfira))

Hi! Iâ€™m Forest ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a computer science student with honours in game development at Carleton
University in Ottawa, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ I love running any events in the game,
security, backend, and cloud spaces. Some of my favorites are game jams,
security CTFs, and interactive cloud workshops.

On the side, I also do lots of open source work in the Rustlang ecosystem ðŸ¦€ Iâ€™m
part of the Rust Gamedev Working Group, and the team lead of the Rust CTCFT
team. Iâ€™m also one of the core developers on Veloren, an open source game
similar to Minecraft. In the Rust communty, I run a monthly game dev meetup, and
co-edit the monthly game dev newsletter.

### Victor Li ([@VictorLi5611](https://github.com/VictorLi5611))

Hey, y'all!! My name is Victor. 

Currently, I'm a 3rd year CS student w/ honors in the AI stream at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. I'm also the Director of Finance or Treasurer of the Carleton Computer Science Society, where I manage our finances and merch. I'm also from Toronto and moved to Ottawa to study at Carleton!! I like to do in my spare time to read manga, watch anime, and playing some chess. If it's sunny out, I also kayak and bike around Ottawa. 

I can't wait to work with you all and might see you in person in the fall semester!!
