# CCSS Summer Dev Projects

## Introductions

### Forest Anderson ([@AngelOnFira](https://github.com/angelonfira))

Hi! I’m Forest 👋

I’m a computer science student with honours in game development at Carleton
University in Ottawa, Canada 🇨🇦 I love running any events in the game,
security, backend, and cloud spaces. Some of my favorites are game jams,
security CTFs, and interactive cloud workshops.

On the side, I also do lots of open source work in the Rustlang ecosystem 🦀 I’m
part of the Rust Gamedev Working Group, and the team lead of the Rust CTCFT
team. I’m also one of the core developers on Veloren, an open source game
similar to Minecraft. In the Rust communty, I run a monthly game dev meetup, and
co-edit the monthly game dev newsletter.
