# CCSS Summer Dev Projects

## Introductions

### Forest Anderson ([@AngelOnFira](https://github.com/angelonfira))

Hi! Iâ€™m Forest ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a computer science student with honours in game development at Carleton
University in Ottawa, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ I love running any events in the game,
security, backend, and cloud spaces. Some of my favorites are game jams,
security CTFs, and interactive cloud workshops.

On the side, I also do lots of open source work in the Rustlang ecosystem ðŸ¦€ Iâ€™m
part of the Rust Gamedev Working Group, and the team lead of the Rust CTCFT
team. Iâ€™m also one of the core developers on Veloren, an open source game
similar to Minecraft. In the Rust communty, I run a monthly game dev meetup, and
co-edit the monthly game dev newsletter.

### Steven Kim ([@kyonghokim93](https://github.com/kyonghokim93))

Hi, Iâ€™m Steven!

Iâ€™m a CarletonU alumni with MA in Applied Linguistics who is now a CompSci student at Algonquin College. I am still new to many CompSci concepts, and I am excited to learn as much as I can.

I am interested in making my own Roguelike in the future, something similar to Darkest Dungeon with Lovecraftian horror theme. My favorite game of all time is Ratchet and Clank.
Nice to meet you!
