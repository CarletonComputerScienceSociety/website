# CCSS Summer Dev Projects

## Introductions

### Forest Anderson ([@AngelOnFira](https://github.com/angelonfira))

Hi! Iâ€™m Forest ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a computer science student with honours in game development at Carleton
University in Ottawa, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ I love running any events in the game,
security, backend, and cloud spaces. Some of my favorites are game jams,
security CTFs, and interactive cloud workshops.

On the side, I also do lots of open source work in the Rustlang ecosystem ðŸ¦€ Iâ€™m
part of the Rust Gamedev Working Group, and the team lead of the Rust CTCFT
team. Iâ€™m also one of the core developers on Veloren, an open source game
similar to Minecraft. In the Rust communty, I run a monthly game dev meetup, and
co-edit the monthly game dev newsletter.

### Igor ([@igortascu](https://github.com/igortascu))
