Hello, Computer Science enthusiasts! We're here to talk about the proposed levy for the Carleton Computer Science Society (CCSS) and why it matters.

## The Rationale Behind the Levy

### Enrollment Growth
Over the past decade, the enrollment in Carleton's computer science program has surged, showing a remarkable 67.29% increase in the last five years alone.

### Budget Struggles
Despite this growth, the CCSS's budget has only recently seen a modest increase to $3000, resulting in a meager $0.86 per student. This budget is inadequate to meet the demands of the expanding student body.

### Comparisons
Comparisons with other program/faculty societies at Carleton reveal that the proposed levy is still considerably lower than those of similar groups.

It should be noted that when likened to other program/faculty societies at Carleton, our levy would be comparably low:

| Society                                                | Levy / Semester | Full Time Enrollment 2022-2023 | Total / Semester   |
|--------------------------------------------------------|:---------------:|:------------------------------:|:------------------:|
| Carleton Student Engineering Society (CSES)            | $44             | 3431                           | $150,964           |
| Sprott Business Students' Society (SBSS)               | $90             | 1634                           | $147,060           |
| Carleton School of Architecture Association (CSAAS)    | $15             | 333                            | $4,995             |
| Carleton Industrial Design Student Association (CIDSA) | $15             | 177                            | $2,655             |

Here's how our old and new budget would look

| Society                           | Current Budget / student / semester | Full Time Enrollment 2022-2023 | Budget / Semester  |
|-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:------------------:|
| Carleton Computer Science Society | $0.75                               | 1999                           | $1,500             |
| Carleton Computer Science Society | $3                                  | 1999                           | $5,287.50*         |

## Proposed Levy Usage

### Hackathons
Funding for hackathons, essential events for skill development and portfolio building, is hampered by the high cost of providing food.

### Main Events
Support for main events like prof nights, socials, workshops, and tech talks is limited by our budget, hindering the potential impact of these activities.

### Week of Awesome
A student-organized week of events comes at a cost, and additional funds will ensure its continuation as a valuable resource for computer science students.

### Office/Lounge Maintenance
The struggle to afford basic necessities like printer ink, markers, and potential upgrades to essential equipment affects the overall functionality of the CCSS office/lounge.

### Website and Online Services
Hosting online resources incurs costs, and additional funds are required to maintain and improve the CCSS's online presence.

### Merch + Outreach
Maintaining an inventory for merchandise requires a down payment that is often a challenge for the CCSS due to limited liquid funds.

## Estimated Cost Breakdown

- **Hackathons:** $4000
- **Week of Awesome:** $1000
- **Fall and Winter Semester Events:** $2000
- **Office/Lounge Maintenance:** $1300
- **Website, Online Projects, and Services:** $200
- **Merch + Outreach:** $1500
- **Total:** $10,000

## Conclusion

The proposed levy of $3 per semester is crucial for the CCSS to continue providing quality events and services to the growing computer science student community. It's an investment in the enhancement of the student experience, skill development, and community building. Your support matters!

**Levy Question:**  
_Do you support the introduction of a levy of $3 a semester for all full-time undergraduate computer science students in the faculty of science (pro-rated for part-time undergraduate computer science students & adjusted for inflation annually by CPI of Canada)?_
