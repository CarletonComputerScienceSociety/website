Hi everyone! My name is Byron McDonald and I‚Äôm hoping to be the Director of Social on the upcoming year‚Äôs CCSS board of directors!

I have experience organizing events, hosting workshops, and leading volunteers, so I am prepared for the position. I also love meeting new people and making connections. Combining the two, I would love to bring fun and meaningful events to Carleton Computer Science students!

As the Director of Social, my main goals would be to organize connection building events and creating ways for students to relax and wind down. Some of my plans are:

**Meet and Greets ‚úåÔ∏è**

It can be rough trying to make connections sometimes, especially with a busy CompSci schedule. Meet and greets are a great way to combat this, with a set time and place that people can prepare their social energy for.

**Game Nights üêâ**

Once you've made connections, it's great to keep them strong! From Jackbox Party games to Dungeons and Dragons, I've found that game nights are an excellent way to have fun and build relationships.

**Painting Workshops üé®üñå**

It can be difficult to get into hobbies that aren't related to school - I'd like to cut out the prep needed to launch into a new hobby. Following a Bob Ross tutorial or learning how to paint miniatures make for fun branches into new hobbies!

**Holiday Parties üéÉ**

Nothing beats a scare filled Halloween horror movie night, or a chill Holiday party with a secret Santa gift exchange! As Director of Social I would love to organize events to make the holidays really stand out!

**Student Achievement Showcases ü™ü**

As the capstone to the year, I plan to organize a student showcase where all CCSS students can demonstrate the projects they've been working on through the year. I've had great success with events like this in the past, and I can't wait to see what everyone can bring to the table!

Although not everything can be online, I plan to mix in as many hybrid and online events to reach members that aren‚Äôt able to join us in person, ensuring that even outside of Ottawa connections can still be made!

For any questions that you have you can always reach out to me on Discord at Sleepy9540.

Take care everyone, hope to meet you all soon!

Byron
