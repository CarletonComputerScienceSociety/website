Hi everyone! My name is Byron McDonald and I’m hoping to be the Director of Social on the upcoming year’s CCSS board of directors!

I have experience organizing events, hosting workshops, and leading volunteers, so I am prepared for the position. I also love meeting new people and making connections. Combining the two, I would love to bring fun and meaningful events to Carleton Computer Science students!

As the Director of Social, my main goals would be to organize connection building events and creating ways for students to relax and wind down. Some of my plans are:

- Game nights
- Meet and greets
- Student achievement showcases
- Painting workshops
- Holiday parties

I plan to mix in hybrid and online events to reach members that aren’t able to join us in person, ensuring that even outside of Ottawa connections can still be made!

For any questions that you have you can always reach out to me on Discord at (Sleepy@9540).

Take care everyone, hope to meet you all soon!

Byron
