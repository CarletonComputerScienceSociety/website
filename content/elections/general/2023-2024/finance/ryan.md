Hello! I’m Ryan! Some of the goals that I have are:

**Continuing and expanding the sale of merchandise**

As a tradition, the CCSS has been selling hoodies and other merchandise. I plan on continuing this tradition and expanding into different types of merchandise which are priced fairly. As I am starting a business entrepreneurship minor next year, I will apply my new knowledge to these ventures to further performance and sales.

**Hosting more study sessions and creating resources**

In my current position as First Year Representative for the 2022-2023 school year, I have been planning more academic events to provide more support for students. Redistributing the budget to allow for a better balance between social and academic events will, in turn, increase the resources available to students to ensure everyone can succeed.

**Voting on events**

The fall and winter general meetings currently allow students to see and vote on the budget for each term. However, I understand that people’s needs and ideas change over the course of each school term. What I want to achieve is having a portion of the events budget set aside for events which people can vote upon throughout the term. This will allow everyone in the society to stay involved and have a say in what we should offer.
