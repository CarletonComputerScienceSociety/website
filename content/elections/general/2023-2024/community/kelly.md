Hey! I’m Kelly, a first year computer science student, and I’m running to be your next Director of Community. I’m passionate about making university a memorable experience for everyone and I believe that finding a sense of community is super important. As the Director of Community, I would love to: 

**1. Get you involved!**

The CCSS is a place created by students, for students. Along with the super fun events, 
I would like to ensure lots of different volunteer opportunities for you to get involved so 
that you can make an impact. 

**2. Establish a welcoming and inclusive community**

As someone who didn’t have much experience coming into first year, I know how intimidating some of these events may seem. I would advocate for more events that are relevant to tech and on the topics of interests of the student body (you guys!!). All events would be friendly for all skill levels and nobody should be scared of attending an event because they don’t think they’re experienced enough. 

**3. Further grow Carleton’s computer science community by collaborating/connecting with the various other CS clubs** 

Besides the CCSS, Carleton also has many other tech clubs such as WiCS, CU 
Blueprint and the AI society. I hope to collaborate with them to help expose everyone to various topics and useful experiences. 

The CCSS is a place for all CS students and I hope to help establish a welcoming community that will leave a memorable impact on everyone’s university experience.
