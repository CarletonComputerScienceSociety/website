As the Carleton Computer Science Society President, my platform will focus on three key areas: community building, education, and professional development.

🏡 Community Building:
- Foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or background.
- Promote collaboration between different Computer Science clubs and organizations to serve the student community better.
- Making myself available via Discord and our lounge to ask questions about either school, professional life and how they can get involved with our community 

📚 Education:
- Host workshops and training sessions for students to improve their technical skills, including programming languages, data structures, and algorithms.
- Work with the faculty to identify and address areas where students may struggle academically and provide resources to support them.

🔎 Professional Development:
- Connect students with industry professionals and alumni through networking events and speaker series.
- Offer resume and cover letter reviews, interview practice, and other resources to help students prepare for job interviews and internships.

Overall, my goal as the Computer Science Society President is to create a supportive and engaging community for all Computer Science students and provide them with the resources they need to succeed academically and professionally.
