Hello! My name is Shirley and I‚Äôve had 2 years of experience on the CCSS council. I‚Äôve conducted various events and hosted dozens of initiatives while being a representative. Once elected, I will organize a variety of initiatives to help with academic success, create opportunities, and introduce new topics within the tech industry! The details for the initiatives are below:

1. Study Sessions üìö
    - If elected, I will make sure to conduct study sessions on difficult courses to help prepare for midterms and exams. These study sessions will be assisted with resources such as the discrete math website.

2. Tech Workshops üñ•Ô∏è
    - CS is pack full of different topics and I love to create workshops which will introduce them. Some examples I would like to talk about are:
        - Cloud Computing, specifically services such as Amazon Web Services(AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.
        - Web Development Technology, specifically libraries like React, frameworks like Vue, and databases like MySQL.
        - Creative Coding! It‚Äôs a fun topic involving generative art, data visualization, sound art, and more!

3. Mock Tech Interviews üíº
    - Tech interviews are an essential part of the job seeking process in the CS industry. As such, I believe it‚Äôs important to practice being in tech interviews so you can achieve success when you‚Äôre looking for your next internship/job. I plan to conduct mock tech interview sessions where you can receive feedback for your performance and get familiar with the process.

4. Industry Presentation and Resources üé§
    - Next year, I will make sure to create info sessions on how to prepare your resume and ways to improve your chances of finding an internship/job opportunity. 
    - Resources will also be made to aid you in your job seeking process! Some examples include a list of networking events, guides to edit your LinkedIn profile, and more!
