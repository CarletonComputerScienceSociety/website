Hello! My name is Kimia and I am running in the CCSS General Election for the position of Director of Operations. I have frequently volunteered with the CCSS over the past few months and would be delighted to continue to do so and to have a greater impact and role in the society in order to further continue the efforts the CCSS puts to help represent all undergraduate computer science students. I am passionate about helping out as well as passionate about the community here at Carleton. Even if I am not elected, I wish to continue to help make the CCSS and the community an inviting and pleasant place for everyone.

If elected as your Director of Operations, my focus will be on ensuring all events and initiatives run smoothly and that they are as accessible as possible for all computer science students, this is said in consideration of students living on and off campus. Constant planning and thought of all logistics are just some things that help an event run smoothly and successfully. Another thing I would focus on is volunteers and how they can get involved, creating more opportunities for people of all levels with various interests being brought into consideration. Having opportunities of various styles and considerations will help many different people find something they can do and to earn more experience as well as be able to be a part of the CCSS in a way that is comfortable for them. I will focus on both internal and external operations for the CCSS.

If elected, I will ensure that there will be many different events run that would cater to a wide range of students and that they would continue to be enjoyable and memorable for everyone who attends or takes part in them. I will also seek out input from the community and see what the majority of people would look forward to and would be interested in seeing the CCSS do. With this strategy, the CCSS would run events that students would like to see and that students would be heard. I would achieve this by conducting votes in order to see interests as well as occasionally ask for input from the general public such as for ideas or what they liked in previous events. These would be done both in person and online in order to make it more accessible. 

Thank you for your consideration and for reading this far! If you have any questions whatsoever, feel free to contact me on Discord (Username: ajmr1). I am always happy to hear from other people in the community!
