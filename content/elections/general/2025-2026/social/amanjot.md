### Who Am I? 👤

Hi👋, my name is Amanjot, and I’m excited to run for **Director of Social** for the 2025-2026 CCSS Board of Directors! As someone who loves **socializing and meeting new people**, I believe that a strong sense of community makes the university experience more enjoyable and fulfilling. My previous **leadership experience** has given me the skills to plan events, bring people together, and create an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome.

### Why Am I Running? 🎉

The CCSS plays a crucial role in fostering a **fun and supportive environment** for computer science students. University life can be stressful, and I want to ensure that students have **opportunities to connect, relax, and build meaningful friendships** outside of academics. Whether you're a first-year looking to meet new people or a senior hoping to engage more with the community, I want to create events that cater to everyone.

### My Goals as Director of Social 🏆

If elected, I will focus on:

✔ **Hosting a variety of social events** – From game nights and themed gatherings to larger networking socials, I want to create diverse opportunities for students to connect.

✔ **Building a welcoming and inclusive community** – Ensuring all students, regardless of background or experience, feel comfortable and encouraged to participate.

✔ **Enhancing student engagement** – Gathering feedback to plan events that truly reflect students' interests and working with the Director of Publications making sure they are well-promoted so no one misses out.

✔ **Collaborating with other directors** – Incorporating social elements into academic and career-related events to make them more interactive and enjoyable.

### Let’s Build a Stronger CS Community! 💪

I am passionate about making the Computer Science Society feel like a close-knit and welcoming group. If elected, I will dedicate my time to **creating fun, engaging, and meaningful social experiences** for all students. I would love your support in making this vision a reality!
