Hello everyone, my name is Eros and I'm looking to be your 2025-2026 Director of Industry Initiatives. With our new student levy in place for the upcoming term we as a society are ready to take things to the next level. 

Why should you vote for me? Well let me share with you what I want to accomplish as the Director of Industry Initiatives.

### Laying the foundation for the future

As Industry Initiatives Director, I will lay the foundation for long-term success by creating essential resources that future directors can build upon. This includes a comprehensive database to track company partnerships, a strategic playbook to guide outreach and relationship-building, and other key tools to streamline industry engagement. With these resources, we can secure stronger partnerships, increase funding for major events, and create lasting connections between students and industry leaders ensuring our society continues to thrive for years to come.

### Sponsored Events

Our society represents one of the largest communities of computer science students across all of Ontario. By partnering with us, recruiters gain direct access to top-tier talent. Industry leaders who will drive innovation in their fields. This unique opportunity allows organizations to connect with exceptional candidates while supporting our flagship events, such as Week of Awesome and Hack the Tunnels. With their financial support, we can take these events to new heights, creating even more impactful experiences for students and recruiters alike.

### Networking Events

Finding a job, whether it’s for co-op or after graduation, is one of the biggest challenges CS students face. One of the best ways to land opportunities is through networking with recruiters, but many students don’t get enough chances to do so. That’s why I want to organize more networking events with top companies, giving you better access to industry professionals, career insights, and potential job opportunities. 

I’m excited for the chance to serve you as the Director of Industry Initiatives and to work with students and companies alike to provide the best possible opportunities for you and your future.
