Hi there! My name is Nguyen, and I'm a 4th-year CS student. Over the past two years, as a former teaching assistant I've had the privilege of helping host numerous academic events with the CCSS. My goal is simple: to provide you with the tools, resources, and support you need to succeed in your studies.

If elected, here's what I plan to accomplish:


### ‚úèÔ∏è Expanding Publicly Available Academic Resources 
Having worked on the [Carleton Computer Science Question Repository](https://questions.carletoncomputerscience.ca/evaluations/1) (and discretemath.ca), I know how invaluable access to past midterms, assignments, and exam questions can be. I plan to enhance this repository by introducing new features and expanding the range of subjects covered, ensuring that every student has a comprehensive study resource at their fingertips. 

### üñ•Ô∏è Deep Dive Into Academics at Carleton 
I want to bridge the gap between classroom learning and real-world research through dynamic academic events. My initiatives include: 
- **Connecting You with Professors:** Organize Q&A panels and interactive sessions where professors share course insights, research interests, and career opportunities. This will give you a firsthand look at engaging research projects and publications that exist at Carleton.
- **Sharing Essential Academic Strategies:** Host workshops that focus on effective problem-solving, exam techniques, and study strategies designed to help you succeed in all CS courses at Carleton. 

### üë• Enhanced Study Sessions 
Over the years, I've both organized and participated in various study sessions for courses like **COMP 2402** and **COMP 2804**. I plan to continue these sessions throughout the 2025/2026 academic year‚Äîand expand them to include dedicated midterm and exam preparation sessions‚Äîso that every student has the collaborative support needed to excel. 

If you have any ideas or questions, feel free to reach out to me online or catch me in the lounge!
