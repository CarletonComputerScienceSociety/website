Hey everyone! My name is Aditya but you probably know me as Jacc. I‚Äôve been involved as a volunteer with the CCSS throughout my time at Carleton, and I would like to continue next year as your Director of Academics! 

Here are some of the highlights from my platform. If you would like to read my full campaign platform **checkout my [notion page!](https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69?pvs=4)** 

Feel free to also click on any of the following points for more details.

### ‚ùì [Expanding the Computer Science Questions Repository](https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69#1a67fd7bee2680d78821fe0250ddba70:~:text=1%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%20Expanding%20the%20Computer%20Science%20Questions%20Repository)

Currently, the CS Questions Repository only has past evaluations for COMP 2804. I will work on adding support for other CS courses, starting with the courses most students struggle with, such as COMP 1805 and COMP 2402. 

### üì¢ [Delivering Student Feedback Directly to Instructors](https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69#1a67fd7bee2680d78821fe0250ddba70:~:text=2%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%20Communicating%20Student%20Feedback%20for%20CS%20Courses)

Currently, there aren‚Äôt many accessible ways for students to provide feedback about courses to the School of Computer Science. I would like to communicate feedback regarding some of the biggest issues with certain courses during my term as the director of academics, while also implementing a long term solution for consistently passing on student feedback to course instructors

### üìö [Improving Study Sessions](https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69#1a67fd7bee2680d78821fe0250ddba70:~:text=3%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%20Improving%20Study%20Sessions)

I will continue to organize study sessions for COMP and MATH courses, while also working to improve their format and organization. 

### üíº [Reworked Schedule for Career Focused Events](https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69#1a67fd7bee2680d78821fe0250ddba70:~:text=1%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%20Improved%20Schedule%20for%20Career%20Focused%20Events)

Many of our career focused presentations take place in January, which is when students are already in the process of applying to summer internships. I will push for our presentations 

### üî¨ [Bigger Focus On Research](https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69#1a67fd7bee2680d78821fe0250ddba70:~:text=2%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%20Bigger%20Focus%20on%20Research)

Other than our Research in Undergrad event, we do not provide much support to students interested in pursuing research. I will both introduce new initiatives and bring back older ones to help students learn more about research opportunities as well as make connections with professors that can potentially supervise them. 

### üìù [Resources for Finding Internships](https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69#1a67fd7bee2680d78821fe0250ddba70:~:text=3%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%20Resources%20for%20Finding%20Internships)

Some information from the COOP 1000 course does not really apply to the process of finding tech jobs. I will ensure the creation of written resources that are tailored towards helping CS students land internships. 

### ü§ù [Creating Mentorship Opportunities](https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69#1a67fd7bee2680d78821fe0250ddba70:~:text=2%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%20Mentorship%20Opportunities)

I would like to bring back the CCSS Development Mentorship Program to allow first year students to receive one on one support from experienced upper year mentors. 

### üí∏ [Setting a Precedent for the Management of Levy Funds ](https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69#1a67fd7bee2680d78821fe0250ddba70:~:text=1%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%20Creating%20a%20Precedent%20For%20the%20Management%20of%20Levy%20Funds)

With our budget essentially being three times bigger than previous years, I will work in collaboration with the rest of the board to ensure that we set a precedent for the proper management of our increased funding. 

### üé• [Using our Youtube Channel](https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69#1a67fd7bee2680d78821fe0250ddba70:~:text=3%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%C2%A0Using%20our%20Youtube%20Channel)

With the funds from the levy, we can invest in proper AV equipment to record and share our events and significantly increase the number of people that are able to benefit from them. 

Thank you so much for reading through my platform! I look forward to giving back to the Computer Science community here at Carleton next year :)
