As a computer science student, I know how challenging and rewarding our courses can be. If elected as Director of Academics, I’ll work to make learning more accessible, engaging, and supportive for everyone.

I plan to:

- Expand peer tutoring and study groups.
- Organize talks with industry professionals and researchers.
- Host coding competitions, hackathons, and workshops.

My goal is to help students succeed by providing the right resources and opportunities. Let’s make academics fun and enjoyable together!!
