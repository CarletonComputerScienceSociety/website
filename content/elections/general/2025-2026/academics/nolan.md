Why I Want to Run

Hey, Carleton CS crew! 👋 I’m Nolan, a first-year CS student running for Director of Academics. New to coding, I get how tough this program is—late nights, steep curves. I want to make YOUR academic journey smoother with practical support starting Fall 2025. Inspired by CCSS events (like “Master Leetcode Challenges” and “DevOps with Ciena”), I’ll bring fresh crash courses and resources to boost our success.

What I’d Do

If elected, here’s my plan for next year:  

### 1. Crash Courses That Click 📚  

- Kick off beginner crash courses on version control and web basics (e.g., Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)—skills we need early but don’t get soon enough.  
- Make them hybrid (in-person/Zoom) so all can join, no excuses.

### 2. Peer-Led Study Groups 🧠  

- Host study groups with experienced students for any course in demand—swapping ideas, prepping for exams.  
- From first-year hurdles to upper-year challenges, I’ll connect you with peers who’ve been there.

### 3. Career Boost for All 🚀  

- Launch a peer mentorship program pairing upper-years with lower-years for resume tweaks, interview practice, project advice.  
- Host skills workshops on tools (e.g., Python, Git) and job-prep essentials (e.g., interviews, portfolios) for all levels.  
- Build a “CS Toolkit” with project ideas, certs, and co-op tips to help you shine, whatever your year.

### 4. Always There for You 🤝  

- Run regular study sessions (like my finals one on my floor).  
- Be your go-to at the lounge (I volunteer there—say hi when you see me!) or online—anytime you need help.

### About Me

I’m a first-year CS student, active with CCSS events and lounge volunteering. I’ve hosted a study session on my floor and helped classmates in person and online. Grades and routines drive me, and I’ll bring that focus here. I’m not alone—YOUR ideas fuel this. Let’s make CS stronger—VOTE Nolan Druid! 🗳️
