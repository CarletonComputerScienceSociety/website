Hello everyone! I’m Veronica, the current president and previous first-year representative, and I am running with hopes of being re-elected as CCSS president for the coming year!

If I am re-elected, the following is what I would hope to accomplish during my term:

### Ensuring Proper Use of Levy Funds

Throughout the past couple of years, we have been vouching for the establishment of a levy fee of $2.50/term for full-time students - in hopes of maintaining the operational baseline that the CCSS maintains.

As I served as the Chair of the YES committee, and helped ensure that the levy referendum passed last year - I am highly committed to ensuring that the money that we receive from students benefits you the most.

As this year is the first year that this is going to be in place - it is essential that a proper basis is set, making sure that the funds are spent sustainably in the future.

### Increasing Development Opportunities

Because of the effects of the recent pandemic on the community, there are fewer opportunities to build projects and get development experience.

What I plan to do to improve this:

- Day-long development sprint events - as not everyone has the opportunity to commit to a multi-day hackathon, I suggest that we offer opportunities for students to create mini-projects within the span of a day. This gives students the benefit of learning alongside others in a non-academic setting, as well as the opportunity to meet peers that they might not otherwise.
- Month-long development events - since hackathons don’t really let you build something very robust because of time constraints, offering students an event where we give a prompt and give students a month to create a project based on the prompt will offer a different experience.

### Increasing Accessibility

Everyone has instances where they might want to go to a certain event, but they might not be able to make it because of timing constraints, or maybe they cannot make it to campus for that particular time.

What I suggest we do about this:

- Hybrid approach to events - when possible, we offer an option to tune in online via Zoom or some other platform.
- Recording events - if we are offering an online/hybrid option for an event, this also opens the opportunity to record events through that platform
- Online events - during the pandemic, there were online events offered, as on-campus events were not possible. I suggest that we bring back some of these events, such as speed-friending!

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this far, and I hope you have a lovely rest of your term!
