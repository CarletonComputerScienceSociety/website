Hey everyone 👋 I'm Jacc, your current Co-Director of Academics and former Director of Publications. I'm running for CCSS President, and here's what I'm hoping to accomplish during my term:

### 1. Bigger Focus on Development Opportunities

**The problem:** </br>
The CCSS hasn't consistently planned initiatives that help students build development skills outside of coursework. We often give students the advice that they need personal projects to stand out, but don't provide enough structured support to actually help them do that.

**If elected, I will:**

- Revive **[Dev Club](https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-10-27-dev-club-show-and-tell/)** - regular sessions where students can work on personal or group projects, receive mentorship, and showcase what they're building (with free snacks!)
- Organize technical workshops covering practical skills relevant to today's industry but not taught in courses.

**Goal:** </br>
Students go into internship and full-time job searches with stronger portfolios and hands-on development experience.

### 2. Making Sure CCSS Initiatives Reach Every Student

**The problem:** </br>
Most events only benefit students who can make a specific 1–2 hour time slot. If you have a class, work, or anything else going on, you miss out entirely.

**If elected, I will:**

- Set a strong precedent for our new content creation role and use it to reach students who aren't able to attend our events in person.
- Turn key events and useful information into short videos and posts, and use our platforms to spotlight what Carleton CS students are building and achieving.

**Goal:** </br>
More students benefit from our initiatives regardless of their schedule, and the CCSS becomes something students can actually follow and engage with on their own time.

### 3. Better Collaboration with Other Clubs

**The problem:** </br>
Clubs often run overlapping events that force students to choose between them. We also now have increased funding through the levy that can be used more strategically to support initiatives that directly benefit CS students.

**If elected, I will:**

- Work closely with other clubs to coordinate scheduling and co-host events where it makes sense, rather than competing for the same time slots.
- Introduce a formal process for tech clubs to apply for funding to support events that directly benefit CS students, such as those run by the Cybersecurity Club, Game Dev Club, AI Society, and others.

**Goal:** </br>
Students get higher quality events, fewer scheduling conflicts, and more opportunities to meet people across the broader tech community at Carleton.

### 4. A More Intentional Event Calendar

**The problem:** </br>
Many events are planned last minute or scheduled at the wrong point in the year. For example, running a "how to prep for job applications" presentation after students have already started applying.

**If elected, I will:**

- Establish a roadmap at the start of the year and plan major initiatives around when they're actually useful for students.
- Structure the event calendar so it naturally guides students. If we're running a "Personal Projects 101" workshop in October, that's your cue to start working on projects.

**Goal:** </br>
Students get the right support at the right time and can be proactive about their academics and careers, not just reactive.
