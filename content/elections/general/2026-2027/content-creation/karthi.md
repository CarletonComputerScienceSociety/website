What's up!! Hello guys, My name is **Karthi Kanthavel** and I am currently the First Year Representative who runs a lot of the CCSS Instagram Reels (yes… the ones you actually watched).

I genuinely enjoy making **fun**, relatable content that gets students to pay attention instead of scrolling past.

I’m the type of person who likes to plan things properly, stay involved, and actually listen to students.

My goal is simple: make CCSS feel more alive, visible, and student-focused.

If elected, I will:

- Keep dropping banger reels that are fun, silly, and more engaging for the CCSS community

- Make sure more people know what CCSS is doing (no more “wait… this event was today?”).

- Stay approachable and present so students always have someone to reach out to.

- Bring fun and creative ideas that bring our CCSS community together.

- Build on what’s already cooking and push our engagement even higher.

The reason why I am running for director of content creation is because I love creating content, supporting students, and bringing energy to this community and **I’m lowkey just getting started 🔥**

### Vote for Karthi AND I promise the reels will only get better from here 😌🔥
