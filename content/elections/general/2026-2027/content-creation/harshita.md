Ever had a conversation with a prof, classmate, or an upper-year student and walked away thinking "_wow, I would've never known that if they hadn't told me_"? I definitely have.🙋‍♀️ 

Maybe it was job search advice that actually helped. Shared struggles in a course that made you feel less alone (looking at you Discrete Structures). A cool CS opportunity you didn't even know existed. All the stuff that spreads through word of mouth meaning most of us never hear it.

Most of us are chronically online anyway, so why not have these things shared digitally? I know what you're thinking: "_we already have a CCSS Instagram, website, discord…_" - Well I think I speak for a lot of us when I say we don't just want event posters. We want more relatable, helpful, and engaging content that actually captures what it's like to be a Carleton CS student!

And well that's the gap I want to fill! My name is Harshita and I'm a third-year CS student who's lived (and struggled) through this program long enough to know what's missing and that's why I'm running for **Director of Content Creation**!

**What I Want to Build:**

- **Turn events into content people actually watch**: CCSS puts so much effort into workshops, events, and tech talks. I want to make sure that energy doesn't just disappear when the room clears out. If you missed it, you shouldn't feel like you missed everything. Think highlight reels, short videos, etc.

- **Practical guides/short reels for the stuff nobody teaches you**: What do you put on a resume with no experience? What do you even say at a networking event? I want to make guides for the "stuff no one tells you about" and for the questions we're all googling at 3am during our mid-life crisis crashouts (can't just be me 😔). 

- **Bring in people worth hearing from**: Alumni, grad students, engineers, recruiters - there's genuinely so much useful insight just one conversation away. I want to create interview content that feels more like a podcast episode than a career fair booth.

- **Content that makes you feel seen!**: Being in the cs program can sometimes feel isolating behind a screen. I want to create content that reminds you you're not alone in this - relatable struggles, shared experiences, memes, and more. 

This also includes:
- **Student Spotlights**: cool projects, niche hobbies, internship experiences, etc.
- **Professor Spotlights**: quick, informal, fun features with the faculty! (I genuinely want to know what my professor's favourite TV shows are)

Wow, you actually read all that - you're a real one 😎 Thanks for reading! I look forward to creating the kind of content that should be reaching every student in this program.
