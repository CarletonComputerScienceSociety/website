### REASONS to VOTE AFAQ VIRK as Director of Industry Initiatives 🔥🔥🔥

- **I am industrious** 🤑 (_2 years of internship experience + 5 years managing a business_) I understand both sides of the table: what employers expect, and what students actually need. I’ve operated in professional environments and built things from scratch on my own time.

- **I will help you get a j\*b** 💼  (_i’ll go so far as to mock interview or tutor you personally, just ask me, I’ve done it before_). I will do more than propose "networking opportunities". For anyone willing to put in the effort to boost their careers, I will meet you there.

- **I talk a lot, but in a good way** 🗣️: I’m comfortable reaching out to people, following up, and building relationships. I will actively connect our society to Ottawa’s tech sector through outreach, alumni, startups, and companies that are hiring students like us. 

- **I have lots of initiative** 🙂‍↕️: (i’ve hosted technical interview prep, helped organize hackathons and networking events, among many others) You have a cool idea? Tell me, let's get it done.

- **I once completed a Leetcode hard all by myself and it only took me four hours. This is the most important qualification.**
