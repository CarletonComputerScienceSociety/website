“From lecture halls to LinkedIn calls, let’s break down walls and land real roles.” - DJ 

I’m running for **Director of Industry Initiatives** because I believe opportunity shouldn’t be accidental, it should be intentional, organized, and accessible to every student. I don’t want to wait for the right moment, I want to create it!

Too often, students (sometimes including myself) feel like breaking into tech is a black box. You apply. You hope. You wait.

I want to change that.

If elected, my goal is simple: \
**Make industry feel closer, clearer, and more reachable for every CCSS student.**

What I Will Do:
1) Build Strong, Ongoing Industry Relationships
2) Launch High-Impact Career Events
3) Make Career Support Continuous, not Seasonal

### 1)  Build Strong, Ongoing Industry Relationships
Not just one-off events, but **lasting connections**.
- Proactively reach out to recruiters, engineers, founders, and alumni via LinkedIn and email
- Maintain a clean, organized contact database for future executives
- Follow up consistently to turn conversations into long-term partnerships

Companies I would prioritize reaching out to:
- **Kinaxis** (strong Ottawa presence, proven interest in student networking)
- **Ciena** (DevOps, networking, and infrastructure exposure)
- **Shopify** (Canadian tech leader with diverse engineering teams)
- As well as startups in Kanata North and cybersecurity-focused firm

### 2) Launch High-Impact Career Events
Here are **three initiatives I would push for immediately**:
- **“Inside the Hiring Room” – Recruiter & Hiring Manager Panel** \
A candid session where recruiters walk through:
  -  What actually stands out in resumes
  - How technical interviews are evaluated
  - Common mistakes students make

- **Technical Deep Dive Series (Engineer-Led Talks)** \
Hands-on sessions with industry engineers on topics like:
  - Cloud architecture & DevOps
  - Real-world cybersecurity incident response
  - Scaling distributed systems


- **CCSS Resume & Interview Sprint Week (January Peak Season)** \
A structured, multi-day career prep series:
  - Resume reviews
  - Mock technical interviews
  - Behavioral interview workshops
  - Networking crash course

### 3) Make Career Support Continuous, Not Seasonal
Career support shouldn’t spike once per term.

I would:
- Keep a running calendar of upcoming industry deadlines and events
- Create short, practical career resources posted on Discord/Instagram
- Ensure events are beginner-friendly so everyone, from all technical skills and backgrounds feel welcome


### Why Me?
I also want to see more of such initiatives, thus I’ll try my best to apply all of the goals listed above. 

I’m comfortable reaching out to new people, sending cold emails, and turning vague ideas into structured initiatives. I’m organized, persistent, and I follow through. If I say I’ll secure a speaker or organize an event, I will make sure it happens.

More importantly, I understand that this role isn’t about “just getting in”, it’s about being active and providing service.

Being visible in the CCSS lounge. \
Listening to student concerns. \
Asking, “What do you actually need right now?”

And then building it.
