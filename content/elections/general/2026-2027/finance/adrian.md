Hello everyone! My name is Adrian Ponce. I’m a Computer Science Software Engineering student entering my third year while minoring in Finance. My vision as your Director of Finance is built on three pillars:

### 1. 📈Strengthening our society’s financial stability:

A critical window to strengthen our society’s financial future relies on Ontario’s historic $6.4 billion investment in the postsecondary sector, which is stabilizing university budgets and expanding high-demand programs like computer science. As Director of Finance, I will ensure the CCSS is ready to take advantage of this moment by planning strategically, managing our resources responsibly, and advocating for new funding and opportunities our growing community deserves. This is the ideal time for strong leadership to secure additional university support and funding so we can better serve every CCSS member.

### 2. 🚀Raising new funding that aligns with our society's core values:

As your Director of Finance, the following strengths of our society will be my priority. They are the experiences that define our society and enrich your time in the program.

**Professional Events with Industry Speakers**: These events help us understand the jobs of tomorrow and how to prepare for them today by exposing us to:
- Future career paths 
- Skills and qualities employers are looking for
- Real-world insights into the tech industry

**Community, Networking, and Student Life**: Activities like hackathons, game nights, and movie nights are more than just fun. They help you:
- Expand your connections
- Strengthen friendships
- Grow academically, socially, and professionally

**My Plan For Creating Funding Opportunities**: My strategy is simple - play the numbers game and maximize our reach. I will contact tech companies, especially startups and growing companies seeking talent. I will work with fellow members of CCSS to secure guest speakers, sponsorships, and donations. In exchange, we will offer direct access to a talented pool of students seeking professional opportunities (ie. co-ops). It’s a win-win model that strengthens both our society and your career prospects.

**Merchandise: Hoodies, T-Shirts, and More**: I will introduce CCSS merchandise so students can proudly represent their program and faculty: 
- Students vote on design options →
- Winning design becomes official merch →
- Hoodies, t-shirts, and other items can now be purchased →
- Portion of the profit goes directly back to CCSS 🌟

This creates both community spirit and a sustainable revenue stream to support future events.

### 3. 🔎Ensuring full transparency in how your money is used:
As Director of Finance, I will ensure complete transparency by:
- Posting weekly budget updates on the CCSS website
- Clearly outlining how funds are allocated
- Ensuring spending aligns with student priorities

You will always know where your money is going.

As we look ahead to a year full of opportunity and possibility, I’m asking for your trust and your vote. I’m ready to work hard, advocate for our needs, and build a stronger financial future for the CCSS that best serves you. Thank you!
