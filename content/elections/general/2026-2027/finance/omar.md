Hello!👋 \
My name is Omar, and I am running for your vote for the position of Director of Finance. 

Let me start by properly introducing myself, I’m a first year Cybersecurity student with long-standing passions for both technology and finance. My free time consists of me working on my homelab or playing video games with my friends. I’ve started volunteering with the CCSS in the lounge during the Fall of 2025. 

In the past, I’ve been on the Finance Committee for Sir Wilfrid Laurier Secondary School where I was tasked with managing procurement requests and tracking over **$40,000** in total donations.

My campaign centers on financial transparency, working alongside other colleagues to secure funding for the CCSS and continuing to work on CCSS merchandise.

### Financial Transparency
As your Director of Finance, I will release regular financial reports ensuring members are able to see where funds are allocated, spent and earned from. Additionally, and most importantly, I will ensure that the CCSS’ financial records remain organized and accessible at all times.

### Securing Funding for the CCSS
Alongside the Director of Industry Initiatives and other Executives, I will strive to secure additional funding for the CCSS from industry sponsors and apply for opportunities available to support the CCSS. Additionally, I will manage funding from the CCSS Levy, alongside departmental support.

### Releasing CCSS Merchandise
Throughout the 2025-2026 year, the CCSS has made excellent strides in merchandise, including the successful release of stickers from the sticker jam. As Director of Finance, I'm committed to ensuring our merchandise initiatives remain financially sustainable while expanding offerings based on members’ feedback.

I appreciate your support and sincerely thank you for reading my platform. Feel free to say hi or pull me aside for a few questions whenever you see me around campus or reaching out to me via email.
