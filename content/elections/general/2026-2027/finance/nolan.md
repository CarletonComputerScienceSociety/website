Hello CCSS! My name is Nolan and I will be running for the Director of Finance for the 2026-27 school year. This year I will be going into my third year of CS with a minor in business. I would like to connect my knowledge of Business and Computer Science to help the CCSS raise and manage money. I plan on working closely with my fellow board members to bring more funding to the CCSS to create more events and opportunities for you!

Here are some of my ideas that I can bring to this role: 

### 🪙 Secure more funding
In order to create more hackathons and opportunities for Computer Science students we need more sponsors. I will find these sponsors by reaching out to as many tech companies, Carleton Alumni and tech startups as I can. While working with board members to be as efficient as possible.

### 🏦Properly Allocate Money
With last year's levy, previous sponsors and new sponsors I want to put this money to good use. At the start of my term I will make a budget for the entire school year to make sure no money goes to waste. I will look over previous years spending and budgets to find what we did right and where we could improve. While keeping full transparency and posting the budget with updates each semester.

### 👂Listen to your ideas
Through google forms and word of mouth I want to hear what you want to do with your money. With approximately $11,000 of funding from students you deserve a say of where this money goes. I want to set aside a portion of the budget for student and volunteer ideas so we can bring fresh new ideas to the CCSS.

### 🎯Set Clear Goals
I want to set achievable, ambitious and quantitative goals that will have a big impact on the CCSS. My first goal is to increase funding by at least %20 from last year. My second goal is to host at least 1 more hackathon event per semester.

Thank you for taking the time to read my campaign, I can’t wait to meet more of you and I hope I can count on your vote! Please contact me with any questions or ideas below: \
