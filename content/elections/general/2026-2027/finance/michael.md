Hey everyone! My name's Michael and I'm running to be your next Director of Finance.

With this year's introduction of the levy, we over budget for new costs like insurance. This leaves us with a surplus of funds to act as a buffer that we can maintain year over year, helping to ensure the long term stability of the society. With this year's costs in mind, going forward, we can allocate more to initiatives that benefit each and every one of you.

### Increase funding for events
With increased funding, we can host larger, more exciting events. Additionally, it’s no secret that the word "free" could make university students scale mountains. That’s why every CCSS event offers free food, ranging from snacks and coffee, to pizza, to veggie and fruit platters.

If elected, I will ensure that our budget  With increased funding, we can host more, bigger events, offering better food.

### Offer funding for other clubs
Computer Science is a wide field, with many clubs catering to particular specializations. These clubs are extremely valuable to our community, but don’t have access to all the funding opportunities available to the CCSS.

If elected, I will introduce a formal process through which clubs serving Computer Science and Cybersecurity students can apply to receive funding for events and initiatives, enabling them to better support their members.

### Invest in the lounge
The lounge is a space that has long served our community, providing a space to relax, work, chat, or even just microwave your lunch.

I will continue to support the lounge through practical investment in the areas that will have the greatest impact on student enjoyment of the space, according to feedback from students, especially those who are regulars around the lounge.
