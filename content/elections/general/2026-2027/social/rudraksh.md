Hi Everyone!!! I’m Rudraksh Sharma, and I am excited to announce that I will be running for the Director of Social this sem!!!


I’m running to be Director of Social for the Carleton Computer Science Society because Computer Science should be more than assignments, labs, and debugging at 2AM. Yes, we grind. Yes, we lock in. But we also deserve a community that’s loud, welcoming, and actually fun to be part of. University goes by fast, and I want to help make sure we don’t just remember the deadlines — we remember the people.

CS can feel intense and isolating sometimes. It’s easy to show up to class, code, and go home without really knowing the people around you. I want to change that. I want events where first-years instantly feel included, where upper-years actually show up, and where you walk in not knowing anyone and walk out with new friends (and maybe a Mario Kart rivalry). Being Director of Social isn’t about throwing random events — it’s about building energy, consistency, and excitement throughout the entire year.

Here’s what I plan to organize:
- 🚀 Welcome Mixer (Start of Each Semester) \
 A high-energy kickoff event with structured but low-pressure icebreakers, team-based mini games, and speed-friending rounds so first-years can quickly meet a bunch of people. Upper-years will be encouraged to join so new students instantly feel welcomed instead of overwhelmed.


- 🎮 Monthly Game & Tournament Nights \
 Rotating themes each month — Mario Kart brackets, board game cafés, card tournaments, chess battles, or even coding mini-challenges. Small prizes, leaderboards, and friendly competition to keep it exciting and give people a reason to come back.


- 🧠✨ Midterm De-Stress Night \
 Right when assignments pile up, we host a chill evening with snacks, music, casual games, and relaxation activities. A space to take a break, breathe, and remember you’re not suffering through midterms alone.


- 💻🔥 Hackathon After-Social \
 After major coding events, we celebrate surviving them. Music, food, photo ops, and time to actually talk about what everyone built — turning competition into community.


- ☕ CS Coffee Chat Series \
 Smaller, cozy meetups where 10–15 students at a time can just talk, network, or hang out. Great for making real friendships instead of just quick event interactions.


- 🤝 Collab Events with Other Societies \
Joint game nights, trivia battles, or themed socials with other programs so we can expand our circles beyond just CS.


- 🎉 End-of-Year Semi-Formal / Celebration Night \
 A fun, well-organized celebration to wrap up the year — music, photos, awards, and a chance to dress up and celebrate surviving another year of CS together.

My focus is simple: more turnout, more hype, more memories. I want people to actually look forward to CCSS events instead of scrolling past the post. I’ll bring organization, creativity, and energy — but most importantly, I’ll bring consistency.

Let’s make this year the one where the CS community feels alive.
