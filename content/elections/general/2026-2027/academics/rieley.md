Hi everyone! I'm Rieley, a 4th year Computer Science student here at Carleton. I have been a TA for many courses including COMP1805 and COMP1405. I have also been the President of the Carleton Music Club for almost a year now. It would be no overstatement to say that I am well versed in organizing and realizing large-scale student initiatives. 

Having worked both with instructors and directly with students, I understand something important:

Academic support only works when it's structured, consistent, and accessible.

If elected, here's what I will focus on:

### Structured Study Support

I will:
- Coordinate midterm and final review sessions well in advance
- Create consistent formats for sessions 
- Recruit strong upper year students and past TAs to lead them
- Expand support beyond just 2804/2402 into high-demand courses

My goal here is to have predictable, reliable academic support every semester.

### A Clear Student to Faculty Feedback Pipeline

Students often feel like their concerns go unheard.

I will:
  - Create structured feedback forms per course
  - Compile trends and communicate them directly to instructors
  - Follow up publicly (where appropriate) so students know their voices were heard

Constructive communication, not complaints about the courses themselves, leads to real improvement.

### Making Research Less Intimidating

Many students are curious about research but do not know where to start. As someone who has taken on a DSRI (Dean Summer Research Internship), which turned into a Research Assistant role, I have working knowledge of learning where to start.

I will:
 - Create guides and resources explaining DSRI, honours projects, undergrad research, and grad school paths.
 - Connect interested students with professors seeking research assistants. 

### Making Myself Available

If elected as a member of the CCSS board, I plan to make myself available to the entire student body. This means staying active in the Discord server, hanging out in the CCSS lounge, conducting regular surveys, and continuing my TAing efforts throughout various COMP courses.

As someone who has been through it all, I plan to help students with any questions or concerns they may have about the Carleton Computer Science program, and to help those whose voices should be heard.
