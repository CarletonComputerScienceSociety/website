Hey everyone!! I’m Sofia, and I’m running for Director of Academics because I genuinely care about making Computer Science more accessible, more supportive, and less overwhelming!

To be honest, CS is a lot. We all know it. Confusing assignments, late night debugging, unsure of how to study, andddd imposter syndrome… feeling like you’re behind even when you’re trying your best... I know. It’s not easy, but I’m here to make sure YOU can easily access useful resources that will help you thrive!

As a First Year Representative, I’ve heard it all, the 3 a.m. debugging breakdowns, the “wait… what is this assignment asking?”, the pre-midterm panic. And it’s made one thing clear: structured, accessible support isn’t optional, it’s a must.

If elected, I will:

📚Organize Study Groups
- Where you get to meet other students in your courses
- A place to study together
- Teamwork and collaboration

🧠 Provide Academic Resources
- Provide practice materials for multiple COMP courses
- Advice from upper-year students
- Study strategies tailored to different classes

💼 Earlier Career & Technical Skill Preparation
- Have technical interview prep sessions
- Resume workshops
- Internship prep

Thank you so much for reading! :)
