You're trying to avoid falling behind while balancing deadlines and lectures.

Better support is what you need: easily accessible materials, productive study sessions, and someone who pays attention to courses.

I've assisted in running review sessions and volunteered with CCSS, so I've seen what works and what doesn't.

### What’s not working for you
- Rather than working with others, you tend to grind alone.
- Some classes seem more difficult than they actually are because there isn't organized support for them.
- Study resources are scattered across random links, Discords, and old files, so just figuring out where to start is work.

### What I’ll fix if you elect me
1. **Well structured study sessions**
- Sessions centered on the specific subjects you claim to be having difficulty with, utilizing test results and feedback.
- Priority on the classes you tell me are difficult at the moment, not just the ones you take every year.

Goal: You don't just take more notes when you arrive; you leave with a greater sense of confidence in your knowledge.

2. **One hub for all your resources**
- Links to practice questions, previous session slides, and "start here" guides are all in one location.
- Increase the size of current question repositories so that more courses—rather than just one or two—have adequate practice banks.
- Make it simple to locate what best suits your exam and course style. 

Goal: You know exactly where to start when you sit down to study.

3. **An easy way to be heard**
- An easy way to express what isn't working in a course.
- Convert that into polite, targeted criticism and deliver it to the appropriate faculty or teaching staff.

Goal: Goal: When a course has clear problems, you shouldn't feel like you're complaining in vain.

If you want your courses to feel a bit less like chaos and more like something you can actually stay on top of, I’d love your **VOTE ALVIN KAPOOR** for **Director of Academics**.
