WHY I’M RUNNING

Computer Science isn’t just challenging anymore — it’s hell and uncertain.

 Layoffs, rising hiring standards, and rapid changes in technology have made one thing clear: working hard is no longer enough if we don’t know what actually matters.
 
Many students are constantly busy: assignments, side projects, interview prep, but still unsure whether they are building the right skills for co-op and beyond.

I am running to strengthen the connection between academics and career preparation. CCSS Academics should not only help students pass courses: it should help students navigate the broader CS journey with clarity and direction.

IF ELECTED, I WILL DELIVER:
1. Coursework-to-Career Playbooks\
I will create structured guides that connect Carleton courses to real-world outcomes. These will explain:
- What practical skills each core course builds
- How those skills appear in technical interviews
- How to turn assignments into portfolio-quality work
- How to study strategically instead of blindly

The goal is to reduce confusion and give students purpose in their coursework.

2. Career Path Toolkits (SWE / AI / Cyber / Systems / DevOps/embedded) \
Concise guides outlining:
- Core skills required
- Recommended course paths
- Relevant tech stacks
- Interview focus areas
- Example project directions

This helps students stop collecting random tools and start building a coherent career story.

3. Personal Project Pipeline (Start → Ship → Present) \
A structured roadmap covering:
- How to choose meaningful projects
- Beginner → intermediate → advanced project progression
- Avoiding tutorial-only portfolios
- Writing strong project descriptions for resumes and GitHub


The goal is more finished, impactful and industry needed projects, half-complete repositories.

4. Alumni & Senior Student Reality Series \
Invite upper-year students, co-op students, and recent graduates to share:
- What actually helped them secure interviews
- Mistakes they made and lessons learned
- How they balanced coursework and career preparation
- What they would do differently

Real experiences provide clarity that generic advice cannot.

5. Academic-to-Opportunity Bridge \
Work with professors and labs to surface opportunities where students can contribute to real tools, scripts, or systems when possible. This creates pathways for practical experience beyond traditional co-op roles.

MY APPROACH

I will focus on practical, structured initiatives that can be implemented within one term and improved over time.

If you believe CCSS Academics should provide clarity, direction, and real preparation for today’s competitive environment, I would appreciate your support.
