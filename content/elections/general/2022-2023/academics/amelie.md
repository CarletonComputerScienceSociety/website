Hello world! My name is Amelie Haefele and I'm going into my third year here at Carleton while currently living on residence. I promise to encourage the academic opportunities and learning of all students in Carletonâ€™s Computer Science Society and any others who wish to join. With the move to online many, including myself have found it much harder to learn.

<ul>
<li>
To combat this I plan to create online and in person events so everyone can choose which medium they prefer.   
</li>
<li>
To do this I will plan to have in person events(rules permitting) and livestream it using zoom and/or discord. Along with connecting chat to the speaker so they are able to answer questions and interact with students.
</li>
<li>
To start this off I plan to create an in person meet and greet/study session on campus for those interested.
</li>
</ul>

So stay tuned for timing and more information. I hope to meet and interact with you all soon!
Thank you so much for reading,

Amelie Haefele

TLDR: I will create a mix of in person and online learning opportunities. I am holding an in person study session to meet people! Stay tuned for more details.
