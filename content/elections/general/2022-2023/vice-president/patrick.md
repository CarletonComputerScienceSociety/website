Hi everyone. My name is Patrick Ene and I’m running to be your next CCSS Vice President!

Firstly, a little about me. I am an international student from Nigeria and I’m also in the Game Dev stream. I generally enjoy spending my free time practicing with my guitar, listening to music, or playing video games (Apex anyone?).<br>
I am considered outgoing and amiable. I am also a forward thinker and very goal-oriented.

I am running to be the vice president because I have always believed in contributing when you can and “passing through the school”. Due to that, I want to be able to use my accrued skills, leadership qualities, and experience to improve the student life of computer science students via the CCSS. You may be wondering what experiences I am referring to. To name a few,  I have been able to serve as:
- Public Relations Officer for Carleton University Nigerian Students’ Association
- Faculty of Science councilor for CUSA
- Vice President Finance for Carleton University Nigerian Students’ Association
- Administrative Director for Black Student Alliance
- President of Carleton University Nigerian Students’ Association
- As well as volunteering in various service centres and offices across campus

Having had these experiences on campus, I have improved myself and plan on using that to give back to the community. Some of the skills/qualities I gained during these periods are time management, effective communication, event planning & execution, and adaptability to name a few. 

If elected as vice president, some of the things I hope to achieve/advocate for include:
- Promoting focus on mental and overall wellness amongst members as Computer Science can be a very tasking program
- Creating an environment where new and older students can feel welcome and engage with events and fellow students
- Continue the optimization of access to resources
- Promote inclusion and intersectionality in all initiatives
