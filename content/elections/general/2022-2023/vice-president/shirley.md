I think that CCSS is a wonderful organization that has brought a lot of wonderful joy to my life. It has supported many CS students through its various social and academic events. I myself have also had some experience organizing events and it was a very enjoyable experience. 

As vice president, I will be sure to help organize the members and make sure the events flow well and are on schedule. My highschool years of experience as secretary and vice president will definitely aid me.

On top of that, once I am elected, I will bring my passion into the CCSS and organize some really fun and unique events. One example of this is creative coding. Creative coding is essentially combining art and computer science. It's a wonderful field and I have already did a workshop on it during my time as a first year rep on the CCSS. If you're into generative art, kaleidoscope art, or flow fields, then get ready for the events for creative coding that will come your way.

Furthermore, I also will provide some events to help you all who need last minute studying or prepping with study sessions. These study sessions will help you go through course content and make sure those stressful 3am-caffine-overdose-sleep-deprived sessions are not so awful.

If you've read up to here. Thank you and I want you to know that you did not waste your very precious time. Give your important vote to me and I'll make sure to become a great vice president.
