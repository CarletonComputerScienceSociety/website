Hi, I'm Forest!

I'm a 4th year student in the Game Development stream. I'm also Carleton's Github Campus Expert; one of fewer than 10 in Canada. I'm a big advocate of open source development, primarily as a core developer of Veloren. Finally, I'm a contributor to the Rust language, where I focus on the community as a lead of the CTCFT team and the gamedev working group.

As the Vice President of the Carleton Computer Science Society, I would focus on empowering the other members of the board. As a previous exec of several years, I want to share what I've learned with the future leaders of computer science at Carleton. In my opinion, the society thrives most when board members help one another, and I want to play that support role for the team.

I've worked on several projects over the last few years, such as Discretemath.ca, and a hackathon to supplement first-year content. As VP of the society, I'll work on creating a better foundation for these open source projects so that students can continue to maintain them after their original developers graduate.

I have a lot more to share about myself and my platform, feel free to read more here: https://www.notion.so/4da7b23599254ef6853f6e7b33f97201

I'm excited for the 2022-2023 school year!
