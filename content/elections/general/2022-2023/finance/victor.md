Hey Everyone! My name is Victor Li, and this will be my second year running for the Director of Finance. I have a lot of experience doing personal and club finances from high school and CCSS. Some of my goals for this year are to:

<ul>
<li>
Continue selling hoodies and other merchandise like t-shirts, pins, and laptop stickers using new designs and possibly use designs from the 2021-2022 Hoodie contest with artists' approval.
</li>
<li>
Document our finances into two accounts instead of one. I will record the Lounge's earnings and expenses separately from the society's academic and social events. We can use our earnings from the Lounge to vote on future equipment or more significant scale events during our general meeting.
</li>
<li>
Move away from spreadsheets and towards professional accounting software to improve the ease of maintaining society accounts and bookkeeping.
</li>
<li>
Promote the importance of the role of the treasurer while being transparent and accountable with our finances.
</li>
</ul>

The challenge of managing budgets and money can be complicated. Still, using the knowledge I've gained through past administrative experience, I am willing to take on this challenge and make our finances as straightforward and uncomplicated as possible.
