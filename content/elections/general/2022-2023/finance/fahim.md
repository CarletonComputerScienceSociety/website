I would like to run for the Director of Finance because it's a great opportunity for me to improve my current skills and give back to the computer science community. Ever since I came to Carleton I wanted to be as involved in the community as I could. Additionally, I'm well qualified for this position given my past jobs and academic courses. I’m currently doing a minor in business and have taken multiple business courses in high school. This is a great opportunity for me to not only improve the finance department but to meet new people and form connections as well. If I am elected, I'll make sure to improve the current budget or create a new one if the need be. I’ll make sure that it benefits and accounts for all department's and individuals’ needs. Furthermore, I'll make sure to request financial aid from the administration and other organizations to make sure all our planned events run smoothly and according to plan.
