Hey everyone! My name is Ben, and I’m currently in 2nd year. Having already had 1 year of experience as your Director of Academics, I believe that I can help contribute to your academic success. Computer science is a hard program to get through, but I want to make YOUR life easier.

Here are some ideas I have to meet that goal:

**Course-specific study groups**

There are a lot of courses that could benefit from organized group study, and over the past year, I've helped run multiple study groups. Sometimes it really helps to have a place where everyone can come together and share their ideas in preparation for a test/assignment. This is something I plan on continuing throughout the academic year, and I would be open to organizing one as soon as there is enough demand. 

**Upper-year Panels**

These panels would be a perfect chance for upper-year students to share any specific study tips, resources, and anything else about a certain course they’ve taken. Speaking from personal experience, I believe that this advice is extremely valuable - especially for new university students, but really for anyone taking any course.

**Career Development Workshops**

Knowing how to sell yourself is a key part in finding any job/co-op position. Creative resume writing, interview performance, and networking tips and workshops can all help. These will hopefully give you guys a head start on finding your all-important first job, and I’m sure we can all use a boost in these fields. The resume workshops I ran this past year were all big successes, and I'm hoping to get them going again.

While the above are some ideas I had for the year, YOU are still my main source of inspiration. Everything I mentioned above is open to your feedback, and I welcome any new suggestions or comments. This isn’t a one-man show: We’re in this together, so let’s make the best of our studies! You can reach me on Discord anytime with questions, and I’ll be happy to answer them.

Let's keep in touch!
