Hey everyone! I’m Ryan, your current Director of Finance for the 2023-2024 school year!

In the past year, here is the impact I’ve achieved:
- Additional funding through finding and researching different funds and their eligibility, enabling the CCSS to run large-scale events like Hack the Tunnels, and
- Increased projected cash spending from $3,000 to $9,000 this year, providing the resources to organize more events, resources, and services for you!

If elected, here is what I plan to do:

<span><b>1. Work with the Director of Industry Initiatives to secure more funding and company-sponsored events 🤝</b></span>

To ensure that the CCSS’ resources scale with the increasing student body size, one of the avenues to explore is company-sponsored events, enabling us to run larger-scale events with potential networking opportunities.

<span><b>2. Continue selling and expanding the inventory of hoodies, other merchandise, and lounge services 🏷️</b></span>

If elected, I will ensure the sale of iconic CCSS merchandise, such as hoodies and new items. These fundraising efforts create more events and services for you.

<span><b>3. Streamline the finance process and become more transparent with our budgets and sources of funding 💰</b></span>

To ensure full transparency, I will upload our budgets on the CCSS website, allowing anyone to view and inquire about the budget, even after the General Meetings.

<span><b>4. Create resources for future CCSS executives and other student clubs 📄</b></span>

To enrich the Carleton CS student experience, I will create publicly available documents on funding sources available to student-led clubs, helping new clubs get off the ground and existing clubs increase the scale of their budgets and events. These resources will also ensure the generational transfer of funding knowledge to help future CCSS executives.

If you have questions about my platform, you can find me in the CCSS discord!
