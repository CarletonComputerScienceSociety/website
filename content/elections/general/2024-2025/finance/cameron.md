Hey everyone! My name is Cameron, and I'm excited to announce my candidacy for Director of Finance. With organization and financial efficiency at the front of my mind, I am eager to tackle the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

**More Active Discussion on Spending Practices**

I believe in transparency and accountability when it comes to spending practices. That's why I'm committed to fostering more active discussions within our community about how we allocate our funds. I will regularly seek input from members, listen to your concerns, and work collaboratively to ensure that our financial decisions align with the needs and priorities of our society.

**Seeking New Funding Sources**

Year after year, the CCSS strives to bring the student body bigger and better events. Those events inevitably rack up a sizeable bill. The university only guarantees us about $3000 per year. That’s nowhere near enough. I advocate for exploring diverse avenues of revenue generation. With me as Director of Finance, you can look forward to:
- Food sales, which have been very successful across campus; who doesn’t love grilled cheese?
- Expanding the availability of CCSS merch throughout the year; I for one am quite jealous of Matthew’s beanie.
- Closer collaboration with the Science Student Society; we as science students pay them a sizeable levy of $12/year, but we don’t actually collaborate all that often. By working together, we can ensure our contributions are maximized for the benefit of all CS students.

**Lounge Experience Improvements**

I spend all my spare time on campus in the lounge. I know it's an amazing space that we all love, but I also know it can be better. I'm committed to including our lounge as a solid budget point, and surveying our patrons to hear what YOU want out of the space that isn't being offered. 

**Improving Financial Responsibility**

By implementing clearer guidelines and procedures, we can ensure that managing our finances becomes more straightforward and less time-consuming for everyone involved. This includes transitioning away from outdated methods and embracing more efficient and sustainable solutions. This will include:
- Better tracking of purchases
- Faster reimbursement processes for volunteers
- Improved allocation of funding; with an upcoming levy vote, proper fund management is crucial.

I'm overjoyed for this opportunity to serve as your Director of Finance and to work together to build a stronger and more financially sustainable student society. With your support, I'm confident that we can achieve great things. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to earning your vote!
