Hello, my name is John. I’m your current Social Director and former First Year Rep.

In my two years at the CCSS, I've hosted many events for our community, If elected, I will improve the behind-the-scenes operations of the CCSS to ensure a continued delivery of high-quality events and services to all computer science students.

#### ☁️ Hosting a Balanced Variety of Events
We’ve had an imbalance of events in terms of the kinds of events. Academic vs social vs industry. If elected, I will ensure that we have a balanced mix of events that cater to all students.
<ul style="margin-top: -0.75rem;">
<li>Hosting industry initiatives like networking events with Solace or Kinaxis for students to connect with employers.
<li>To alleviate study stress, let's organize games nights and movie nights!
<li>More meaningful long-term projects would not only enhance students' skills but also enrich the CCSS community.
</ul>

#### 🙋‍♂️Improving Our Volunteer Experience
As of now, volunteers don't have the best experience. They aren’t sure where they fit into the society? If elected, I will ensure that volunteers know how to involve themselves in a healthy and productive manner. 
<ul style="margin-top: -0.75rem;">
<li>We'll match volunteers with experienced executives, so volunteers can dip their toes in some of our operations safely. Executives also gain mentorship opportunities.
<li>Monthly feedback sessions from volunteers will be prioritized to gather input on how we can enhance our operations. 
<li>Let's diversify volunteer opportunities beyond just lounge duties. We're exploring roles such as announcement and logistics volunteers, allowing you to explore your interests and contribute in multiple ways.
</ul>

#### ⬆️ Scaling Up Events & Collabs
We've seen a significant increase in the number of events we've hosted this year. If elected, I will ensure that we have the resources and infrastructure to scale up our events and collaborations with other organizations. 
<ul style="margin-top: -0.75rem;">
<li>Collabs would significantly boost attendance. Our events typically draw 20-30 attendees. My Cross-Club Potluck & Games Night garnered an attendance of up to 100 people.</li>
<li>Collaborations ensure better funding for our events. With each event usually allotted a mere $20 budget, pooling resources with other clubs allows us to afford prizes, equipment, and refreshments. For instance, Hack The Tunnels required a budget of $3000, which could have been less burdensome with contributions from other clubs.</li>
<li>Collaborations foster a stronger sense of community. By collaborating, we can create a vibrant community where students can engage in various activities beyond the CCSS.</li>
</ul>


#### 🗓️ Planning Ahead of Time
As of now, events are only planned a few weeks in advance. If elected, I will ensure that we plan events at least a month in advance to ensure that we can deliver high-quality events to our community.
<ul style="margin-top: -0.75rem;">
<li>Planning ahead ensures that we secure event venues well in advance, giving us ample time to announce the location two weeks ahead.</li>
<li>Planning ahead will allow us to trust volunteer with more responsibilities such as room booking, poster creation, and presentation development</li>
</ul>
