Hello everyone, Iâ€™m Veronica and I am running in hopes of being voted in as the CCSS President for the coming year! 


As your president, the following is what I would hope to accomplish during my term:

**â˜•Coffee Chats**

Within the past year - I have noticed that having connections with professors, and even upper years is incredibly helpful. However, as it stands, getting those connections going is quite difficult. This is why I strive to create a viable **coffee chat** system.

The benefits?
- Creating personal connections
- Weekly/bi-weekly roster of participants
- Continual system improvements - through user feedback

**Improving the âœ¨Volunteer Experienceâœ¨**

For those of you who are already involved with the CCSS, or have tried to get involved in the past - you know that the current volunteer experience is not ideal. 

How I would like to improve the system:
- Making use of the unique talents in our community
- Making it easier to get involved
- Improving volunteer engagement

**ðŸ“ˆIncubating Growth**

In the past, not only were there presentations about how to grow by yourself, but there existed opportunities that incubated the communityâ€™s growth

As of right now, the only real opportunity that was present this year (not including over the summer) for people to be able to grow on a personal basis - was Hack the Tunnels.

What Iâ€™d like to see through in the next year: 
- More hands-on workshops - maybe even a series of events, in order to provide the necessary time to grow
- Revival of certain opportunities - such as the [development mentorship program](https://ccss.carleton.ca/news/ccss-development-mentorship-program/), and [Carleton Dev Day](https://devday.carletoncomputerscience.ca/) 

**Feedback âœ¨**

As I have realized recently - there isnâ€™t really a viable way for people outside of the board of directors to provide the society with feedback. As we are a departmental society representing over 2000 students, it would only be fair to have an opportunity to provide us with feedback that is accessible to everyone.

What I proposeâ€¦
- Feedback form - sent out after big events
- Suggestion form - available on the website, for continuous integration


**Thank you for taking the time to read my platform!**
