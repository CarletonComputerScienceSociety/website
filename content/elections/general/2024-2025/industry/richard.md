Hi!

I'm Richard Kim, a 4th year in Honours BCS. Some of you may know me as this year's VP, the COMP 2406 TA (from previous years), or a peer mentor at SSSC!


So, why me as Director of Industry Initiatives?

- Already On It: As the current Student Ambassador at Nokia, I've been coordinating with Nokia recruiters to set up a networking event this September. For those eyeing the Co-op job board, you'll know Nokia is one of the biggest employers. This event is your golden ticket to meet Nokia professionals and get insights that could be crucial as you apply for Co-op positions.

- Not Just a One-Trick: Dispite only playing Darius top in League, it will not be a similar case here. I've been attending various networking events and have made connections with recruiters from companys other than Nokia as well. I will be trying to bring in various tech companys from Ottawa so everyone gets a chance to create those diverse connections.

- Been There, Done That: As a senior (4th year), I've lived the Co-op hustle. Networking isn't just useful; it's essential. It's all about connecting with the right person at the perfect time. I'm here to ensure that Carleton CS students have those opportunities.

- Your Voice Matters: Got an idea for a fun networking event? I'll be listening. This role is about making sure you get the most out of these opportunities, so I will be happy to hear your feedbacks and improve on them.
