Hello! My name is Rebecca, and I’m a 3rd year(ish) CS student. You may know me from your classes, from the Cybersecurity club, from CCSS events, or from seeing me hang out and answer questions in the CCSS Discord. I believe the CCSS could greatly expand on the resources it is offering to students and I think I’d be a great person to help make that happen. Overall, my goal is to help create a permanent archive of searchable content that could be accessed by students asynchronously.

Additionally, I have experience that would help me in the role of Director of Publications: I have been a copy-editor, layout designer, team lead, editor, and writer for various student publications. I have also published essays in some literary magazines and serve as a volunteer editor at Pencilhouse. You can find a sample of my writing [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TSKbyAeZPLYZj2SdCO5m1_ydJmMj9tOq/view?usp=sharing), adapted from the talk I gave at the CCSS Tech Talk Night last year.

Here are some ideas for articles/resources I would love to get off the ground:
- An FAQ page for incoming first year students
- A series of articles spotlighting different breadth elective choices, and possibly exploring certain minors
- “Sh*t I wish I knew”, but as a blog series - a column where upper year students reflect on their experiences
- A “How to get your first internship" series that goes over ideas for side projects, crafting a strong resume, networking advice, job application strategies, and interview tips
- An archive of transcripts, summaries, and/or slides from CCSS talks and events
- Interviews with faculty members, clubs, students and alumni doing computer science-related or adjacent activities
- Custom-built interactive resources for learning introductory discrete math, for example games like [this one](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/trequetrum/lean4game-logic).
 
Above all, I want to hear more about what kind of articles and resources you want, and I’m always down to answer questions or listen to concerns.  Do you have a cool idea that isn’t represented here? Feel free to reach out to me on Discord, track me down in person (I'm often in the CCSS lounge), or email me at rebeccakempe@cmail.carleton.ca
