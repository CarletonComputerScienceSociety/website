Hey! I’m Mary-Emma, a third year Computer Science student with a minor in Professional Writing. I’ve volunteered at CCSS events in the past and have enjoyed attending their events since my first year at Carleton. Writing is a passion for me and I’m excited to combine my content creation experience from my Professional Writing minor with my love of computer science to help promote the CCSS.

As the Director of Publications, I would love to:
1) Create content about upcoming and previous CCSS events.
The CCSS hosts a wide range of events, which provides a great opportunity to share regular articles with details on upcoming events and summaries/photos from recent events. These articles will make it easier for students to find out about upcoming events they can attend and look back on what they’ve learned from past CCSS events.

2) Compile and centralize resources for computer science students.
We all know that university can be challenging, so I want to make it as straightforward as possible for Carleton CS students to access resources about topics such as succeeding in their courses, applying and interviewing for co op positions, and improving their GitHub and personal projects. Having these resources centralized with existing Carleton specific resources such as the Discrete Math Centre would allow for easy access (and one less website to remember!).

3) Highlight excelling students from the Faculty of Computer Science.
CS students make up one of Carleton’s largest programs, so I’d love to highlight the interesting things they’ve been getting up to! Features would include:
<ul style="margin-top: -1rem; margin-left: 1.2rem">
<li>Exciting student research projects</li>
<li>TAs that go above and beyond</li>
<li>Interesting co op positions or projects</li>
<li>Any other students that are changing the face of computer science here at Carleton</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-left: 2.3rem">These features will allow students within the Faculty of Computer Science and outside of it to see the great work that goes on here.</div>

The goal of the Publications platform is improve your student experience as CCSS members, so I welcome any suggestions about what resources and content you want to see. Building this platform will be a collaborative effort, so I want to be continuously incorporating feedback to make it a success.
