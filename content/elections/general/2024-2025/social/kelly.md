Hey! I’m Kelly and I’m passionate about making university a memorable experience for everyone. Over the course of this school year, I’ve hosted various successful social events such as the Halloween Hang, Bob Ross Paint Night, and Mooney’s Bay Picnic. If elected as the Director of Social, I would want to introduce new social initiatives and plan even bigger fun events to connect students. Some of my goals for the CCSS in 2024-2025 are to:

#### Collaborate with other CS clubs

What better way to organize bigger social events than to collaborate with our amazing CS clubs? In addition, I’d love to bring back the CS club expo at the beginning of the year to help showcase the various tech-related clubs we have at Carleton. 

#### Create more engaging events and chances to connect 

After running my fair share of events, I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t. I’m looking to host more engaging events for students to connect, have fun, and create long-lasting memories.

<div style="margin-bottom: -0.3rem">Some events I’d like to run:</div>
<ul>
<li>Campus-wide manhunt</li>
<li>Game tournaments (sports and video games)</li>
<li>Debate-style/Podcast-style speed friending</li>
</ul>

#### Host events that students want to see

We have so many students in computer science and I’m sure many of you have amazing event ideas! I want to help more students get involved by actively seeking input and helping them bring their ideas or suggestions into reality. 

Overall, my goal as the Director of Social is to build a supportive and welcoming community for all Computer Science students through engaging social events.
