Hello everyone! My name is Aditya but my friends call me Jacc. Iâ€™m an international student from India, currently in my first year of Computer Science with planned minors in Law and Film. Throughout this year, I have been a volunteer for several CCSS events. 
I am now running to be the Director of Social and hope to have a bigger impact on the Carleton CS community next year. Here are some of the ways I plan to achieve this goal:

#### Collaborations With Other Clubs and Student Societies 

I will plan events with fellow CS focused clubs at Carleton, including WICS, CU Blueprint and Game Dev Club. Additionally, I will work on organizing collaborations with other student-led clubs and societies such as the Math, Engineering and Business societies. These collaborations will allow us to expand the scope of our events by leveraging funds from other clubs. Additionally, I believe this will be a great way to expand our social circles and form connections with students from other programs. 

#### Balance between In Person and Online Social Events

I want to ensure that students that are unable to attend our in person events still have a chance to be a part of the community. To achieve this I plan to establish a more balanced ratio of in-person and online social events, and whenever feasible, organize hybrid events to provide you with a variety of options to get involved.  

#### Planning a Wider Variety of Social Events 

In addition to planning events like game nights and paint nights that have been popular in the past, I will also work on increasing the diversity of our social events. 
Throughout my first year at Carleton I have been an active participant and volunteer for events run by other student clubs and societies, which will allow me to draw inspiration from these events and adapt them for the CCSS.
Some events that I aim to organize over the course of the year include holiday themed events like halloween and easter socials, outdoor socials like picnics in the fall and ice skating meetups in the winter, as well as online friendly gaming tournaments and movie nights. 

#### More Social Events with Professors 

I aim to collaborate with our professors to organize more events tailored to their individual interests, as well as work around their schedules to allow more professors to attend our events. This will diversify our current slate of prof socials and allow students to form more meaningful connections with the faculty. 

#### Bringing Your Ideas to Life

If you have an idea for an event that you would like to see happen, or want to get involved with the planning of these events as a volunteer, I want to work with you to help make it into reality.


You can reach out to me with any ideas, suggestions or concerns online, or find me in our lounge (I spend way too much time there so you will definitely run into me).
Thank you for your time!
