If I were elected as the First-Year Representative, my top priority would be to create a strong connection between first-year students and the CCSS. To guarantee that your voices are heard, I want to ensure all communication channels to the CCSS are clear and easily accessible. Staying informed about what the Society is hosting can sometimes feel overwhelming, so I focus on creating digestible updates, through social media, email, or even short video clips. By actively collecting your feedback, I can ensure that CCSS is doing what you want! Whether you have ideas for events, suggestions for improvement, or concerns that need addressing, there will always be open lines of communication through drop-in sessions and constructive feedback forms where you can share your thoughts directly.

Through this position, I am committed to creating an environment where all the first-years feel supported and included by having clear access to society resources. I believe the CCSS should prioritize helping students excel through various opportunities such as networking events with upper-year students. Ultimately, I aim to ensure that the CCSS becomes a space where everyone can thrive academically and socially so that you can have the best first-year experience possible!
