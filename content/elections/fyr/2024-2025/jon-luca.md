Hey! 👋 My name is Jon-Luca, and I’m a first-year Computer Science student in the Cybersecurity stream.

I’ll be hanging around the CCSS lounge often, so I’ll be easy to find if you want to chat! 😊

I know university can be pretty overwhelming, and reaching out to a representative might feel a bit daunting. That’s why I want to make myself as approachable as possible.


### 📢 Announcements & Visibility 📢

I plan to make CCSS announcements more accessible to everyone. I’ll share updates on my Instagram and put up flyers and posters around campus so that even those who aren’t active on social media can stay informed.


### 📚 First-Year Study Groups 📚

Staying on top of course content can be challenging. That’s why I’ll host dedicated study group sessions for first-year students. Studying with peers at the same level allows us to strategize together, tackle problems in new ways, and learn more effectively.


### 💻 First-Year Programming Workshops 💻

I’ll organise programming workshops specifically for first years. While we’re all already learning Python this workshop can be about a different language, C++! I’ve learned quite a bit about C++ in Highschool and I’d love to share my knowledge on it with my fellow first years!


### 🎨 Project Showcase Nights 🎨

I’ll set up monthly “Project Showcases” where you can present your personal or class projects in a relaxed setting. It’s a great chance to get feedback from both peers and seniors and celebrate our work!


### 🎉 Social Events 🎉

First year can be a big adjustment, so I’ll organise fun social events to help us connect and unwind. From movie nights and game nights to Kahoots and more, these events will make it easier to meet new friends and enjoy our time here.
