As your first-year representative, I’ll ensure the voices of all first-year students feel heard while pushing to bridge gaps between all computer science students to foster a supportive, tight-knit community here at Carleton University.

While coding is commonly seen as a solitary task, I believe true strength lies in collaboration! First-year can be a very stressful and overwhelming experience for many, so I find it very important for CCSS to host various types of events to support students coming together and connecting with others. By organising a diverse range of events–from casual meetups to collaborative workshops–we can ensure that students can not only find support through their peers, but feel as though they belong amongst a community.

One of the most beneficial resources for a first-year student is the guidance of upper-year peers. While websites and brochures can tell you facts and recommendations, they can’t compare to the insights and personal experiences of someone who has previously been in your shoes. I’m dedicated to supporting more opportunities for first and upper-year students to connect and with their guidance, we can create a stronger community where everyone can thrive.

Recognizing the strengths and achievements of women in computer science is a cause that resonates deeply with my own values and identity as a person. Navigating a male-dominated field can be intimidating, it’s crucial that we as a society can create an environment where all women can feel heard, seen and supported. I’m committed to ensuring that female voices aren’t just acknowledged, but amplified so that all women can not only succeed, but lead the world of computer science with confidence and strength.
