Hello everyone! My name is Chi, and Iâ€™m excited to run for the position of First-Year Representative. Iâ€™m passionate not only about technology but also about the community that comes with it. Iâ€™m from Ottawa so if youâ€™d like some food and restaurant suggestions, feel free to reach out and say hi! :)

As your first-year representative, hereâ€™s what Iâ€™d like to do for you:
### 1. Build a stronger community ðŸŒ±

- Organizing weekly meetups where we can work on projects, discuss coursework, or hang out.
- Never been to a hackathon before? I would love to run a small-scale online hackathon to help you get the gist of it.

### 2. Enhance academic support ðŸ“š 

- Staying on top of your courses can be hard, letâ€™s change that: 
- I will host group study sessions, both online, as well as in person. Have others keep you accountable! 
- Creating more resources to help you study and succeed.

### 3. Worried about finding internships?ðŸ“ˆ

Because it's not all about studying, I will:
- Arrange talks from industry professionals and alumni about different CS career paths
- Publish a database of resources that Iâ€™ve personally made to help you find internship and learning opportunities.
- Run workshops by upper year students to help guide you. I know that the industry is overwhelming and Iâ€™d like to make things a little less so.

### 4. Meet some new people!âœ¨

CS can be lonely a lot of the time when weâ€™re holed up in our rooms working. Meeting new people can be intimidating. I would like to host events for you to connect with others:
- Outdoor group walks (so we can touch grass)
- Movie nights
- Trivia nights with prizes!

If thereâ€™s something specific that youâ€™d like to see happen, feel free to reach out to me, Iâ€™d love to do my best to make it a reality!
