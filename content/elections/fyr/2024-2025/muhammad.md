The word limit is 500 I don't need that let me keep it simple. If I was elected First-Year Representative best believe I'm going to make sure that first year student voices are heard by the board of the CCSS. 

Being a first year student is crazy because more often than not we don't really know what we're getting ourselves into and if you are an international student like me we're going in totally blind. As your rep I'm going to make sure that we know exactly what we're doing, that's important. On top of that I'm going to make sure that we get our recognition and have our impact on the board and the decisions that are made. I use the plural tense in these examples because this position will not be my position it will be OUR position. 

I'm not going to make any crazy promises like some other candidates might because chances are the crazy dreams they are telling are probably just dreams, I will make one promise though, I promise that no matter what I as the representative will do the very best I possibly can to make sure with certainty that the first year students' voices are heard. In short if you have understood nothing I said so far understand this I will do what you need me to do. 

Thank you for reading and I wish everybody applying for this position the very best of luck. I hope to address you guys again as your representative.
