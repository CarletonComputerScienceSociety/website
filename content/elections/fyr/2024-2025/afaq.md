I've worked on all sides of education - as a computer science tutor, student, and school board trustee representing 27000 peers in Eastern Ontario. I've always had a strong focus on making CS education more accessible, extensive, and enjoyable! 

As a first year rep, I'd hope to take advantage of my connections in the field to expand the current resources available to CCSS students - be it academic supports, or funds to create cool projects and plans to organize exciting events. One way I plan to do this is by strengthening connections between the CCSS and the rest of the campus as a whole, helping get our name out further while allowing us to take on bigger, better endeavours. I'd also try to connect us to external sources of funding (because who doesn't like money) by collaborating with organizations who share similar values. 

All of this is with all of your voices in mind - making sure we are adequately represented and able to make strong contributions to this program at Carleton!
