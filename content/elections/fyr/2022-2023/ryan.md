Hey! I’m Ryan! As I am an active member of the Carleton Class of ‘26 and Carleton CS ‘26 (also the owner!) I’d like to put in more work to improve both the academic and the community side of the CCSS.

### 📢 Easy and Open Communication with CCSS 📢

As the owner of the two main first year servers with hundreds of CS students, I am fully immersed in the first year community. I help out a lot on those servers! As an added plus, it is very straightforward to get in touch with me. Contact me with any of your suggestions, feedback and concerns relating to the CCSS and otherwise!

### 📝 Studying events with food and upper year guidance 📝

Having organized a study group for first year students recently, I would like to expand on that idea and create larger studying events. This is a perfect opportunity to meet new people to study with and make new studying friends! If you are struggling with course content, there is no better way to get guidance from others who have already taken the course!

### 🖌️ Improving the CCSS Lounge and activities within it 🖌️

At the moment, the lounge (4th floor in Herzberg Laboratories) is a great place to meet others in Computer Science and relax! By theming the room with CCSS branding (think of a big CCSS logo on the wall!) and hosting events within the lounge, we can make it more inviting. The more people, the better!

### 🔊 Outreach at high schools 🔊

I would like to present to high schools and promote our Computer Science program! With more students, we could get more interaction with people from all walks of life, as well as get more resource allocation!

I guarantee you won't regret choosing me as your representative! Feel free to contact me via ryanchung#3792 if you happen to have any suggestions, feedbacks, or concerns!
