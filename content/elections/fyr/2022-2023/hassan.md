Hey, I'm Hassan Ali! Like all of you, I'm a first-year computer science student. After attending the CCSS Fall general meeting and a few of the other amazing events this week, I decided to run for First Year Representative as I believe that I could have a real impact on the Carleton Computer Science Society.

At the Fall Meeting, there were a few issues that I could address as your First-Year Rep:
1) They needed more staff in order to plan more events for the students
2) They wanted more volunteers and more ideas
3) They wanted a spokesperson for the first years that can convey their sentiments and criticisms to the board of the CCSS

#### 1. Events

In line with the first point, I would try to organize and plan many more events for the first years. These events may include activities like escape rooms or movie nights, or they may be something more club-related. I know that many students want to join a club but may not know what those clubs do or what they offer even after attending the expo. My plan is to communicate with the various clubs on campus to give a more comprehensive demonstration of what their clubs do as an activity for us first years!

#### 2. Volunteering and Community Ideas

Concerning the second point, I would use surveys and face-to-face discussions to try to help you volunteer and become active community members. In addition, if you guys come up with creative services or features, I will work to incorporate your ideas into the CCSS! One of my own ideas that I would like to add is something that I call the "Hackathon Ladder". I know that many other students in our program feel that hackathons are hard to access or difficult to find, so I want to try and make them more accessible while also incentivizing them with some competition. This Hackathon Ladder program would feature news about upcoming hackathons for all students to see as well as a competitive ladder for teams taking part in hackathons. The teams will be split by year in order to make it more fair. Teams will receive prizes for having the highest participation rate, the most placements and accolades in their hackathons, as well as for having the best hackathon project as chosen by you all!

#### 3. First Year Liaison 

Lastly, I will do my best to convey your feedback to the board by speaking with you at events and meetings. As your representative, I will be able to raise your concerns and help the CCSS become a better place for you all. In order to provide the best possible service to all of you, I'll also make sure to pay attention to any feedback you have for me.

I believe that by solving these issues, I can be an excellent first year representative. Once again, my name is Hassan Ali, and I wish you all the best!
