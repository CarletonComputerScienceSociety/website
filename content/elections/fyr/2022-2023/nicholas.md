Hello! My name is Nicholas O’Neil. I was born in Ottawa and I've spent most of my life in the area. I am a first-year Computer Science student. I am interested in the Game Development stream; however, I’m currently not in a stream as I would like to have some time to consider my options. Since discovering the CCSS, I have been enthusiastic about becoming involved, and I believe serving as the First Year Representative is the best way to do so!

As the CCSS First Year Representative, I will commit to doing the following:

<ul>
<li>Reaching out and talking to as many first-year computer-science students as possible!</li>
<li>Ensuring that CCSS events are engaging and accommodating for all first-year students!</li>
<li>Identifying key issues and areas that first-year students are interested in, or struggling with, and organising events or study groups to support students!</li>
<li>Connecting first-year students with upper-year students who have much more university experience, in order to help first-year students thrive and succeed on campus!</li>
<li>Always remaining a friendly face for students to speak with regarding academic concerns, ideas for the CCSS or any other topic on their mind!</li>
</ul>

Above all else, I believe that the First Year Representative should be someone with much energy, and someone who desires to support all of their first-year peers. As First Year Representative, I promise to be that person!

I hope you will vote for me as First Year Representative! Should you have any questions or comments regarding my commitments, you can contact me via email or discord!
