## Hello!

###  My name is Colin, and I am running to be your First Year Representative!

I'd like to be your first year representative in the CCSS, so I can collaborate with current members, as well as with Industry partners, to offer: 

- more workshops,
- more coding challenges, 
- and more events

As an off-campus student, one of the first things I'd like to do is to **coordinate a physical space on campus where students can attend their first year computer science lectures that have been moved online (1405 - sections A, B, C), by reaching out to Professors and the Computer Science department.**

I'll always be open to suggestions and feedback from fellow students on the types of activities and issues that are important to you.

About me:

- I live off campus and hate the 88
- I'm passionate about AWS, [my personal projects](https://github.com/colin-mccormack), and soccer (specifically FC Bayern Munich)
- I like using JetBrains editors, and I'm a big fan of the [JetBrains Student Program](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)
