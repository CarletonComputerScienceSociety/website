### Who Am I and What do I want? 🙃

Hey everyone! My name’s John. As a former High School Engineering Club executive, I’ve got experience hosting events and working with my peers. Whether you’re just starting out in Computer Science or you’ve been doing it for years, I’d have tons of plans for everyone to get involved as your first year rep. We’ll get through this year together!

### 1. Catch-Up and Study Sessions 📖

When we’re lagging behind or nearing exams, I’ll be hosting study sessions and mock exam sessions to help us pass those tough courses. Regardless of how hard it is, I’ll be hosting weekly study group meet-ups!

### 2. Connecting, Collaborating, and Networking Events 🤝 

Some of us moved to Carleton from far away. Some of us have lived in Ottawa all our life. Either way, you might not know where to start with people and clubs. I’ll host get-togethers so we can get to know each other, our seniors, and our professors as well as collaborating with other computer-science related clubs to explore possible future interests.

### 3. Voice Any Suggestions or Complaints 🤚

If there’s anything specific that you want to see, just hit me up and we can work on it together. I know it can be nerve wracking to voice fun quirky ideas, but there are no bad ideas!

### 4. Project Brainstorm and Showcase 🧠

Don’t know what projects to start with? I’ll be hosting workshops and showcases of past programming projects for all levels so we can build up our portfolios and resumes.

### 5. Movie-Nights and Games 🍿

In case you think academics is all I’m bringing to the table, think again! I’d also host movie-nights for films of all genres! I’m also going to throw Smash Bros, Valorant, Mario Kart, Apex, and League of Legends in there as well.

Regardless of who gets elected as the first year representatives, let’s just all get along to make this the best year ever!
