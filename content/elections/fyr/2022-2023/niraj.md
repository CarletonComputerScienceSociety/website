Hello there, my name is Niraj (or Kips!) and I am a first year student just like you! 

I am an international student from India, I play the guitar, but you shouldn’t care too much about that. What you should care about is the fact that I have leadership experience from being captain of my school house and of the sports team for two years, and I am interested in running for first year representative of the CCSS.

I am a very approachable person which is perfect because I will be serving as the medium for first years to voice their concerns to the CCSS. What is the kind of stuff will I do after becoming a first year representative you ask? Here are some examples : 

<ul>
<li>
<b>Arrange workshops for students to get familiarized with basic technologies:</b>
<div>Have you ever felt like your classmates are far ahead of you because they are proficient in software like gitHub, command line, basic programming languages? Workshops like these will help you catch up quickly.</div>
<br>
</li>

<li>
<b>Make the shift to university more comfortable:</b>

<div>As an international student going through the shift and culture shock, events like cultural nights can really help students feel at home, no matter if they are international or live close to Ottawa, because everyone misses home.</div>
<br>
</li>

<li>
<b>Try to get more space for computer science students:</b>
<div>As some of you who have already attended the fall meeting already know, we do not have enough space with regard to the number of students in computer science. I’ll try my best so that we have enough chairs to sit on and enough pizza for everyone next time.</div>
<br>
</li>

<li>
<b>Understand the collective wishes and concerns of the first year body and try my best to solve the problems with the help of the CCSS.</b>
</li>

</ul>
