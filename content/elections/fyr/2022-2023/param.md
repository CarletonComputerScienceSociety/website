### What will I do when I get elected as the CCSS First Year Representative?

### Background

In the beginning stages of my programming career, I have experienced the difficulties that early programmers have gone through. Such as, finding the perfect tutorial, understanding online instructors or any programming classes. Using the knowledge of the struggles early programmers go through, I have decided to help first-year computer science students to succeed in university and also the future. Even though introduction to Computer Science 1 is supposed to start the basics of coding for inexperienced programmers, I can say that the professors don’t always start from the beginning, leaving some students clueless. 

### Plans After being Elected as the CCSS First Year Representative

#### Hosting workshops for new programmers

One of the best ways to learn coding is practicing every module that is taught. In these workshops the instructors will give fun and interactive projects /activities to participants. Instead of long lectures and getting bombarded with information, these workshops can help the participants to go at their own pace and have fun when programming.
This workshop is also designed for refining or enhancing your skills in programming. You can either work with your peers or any other mentors that are present in this event. You can also get help in any projects or assignments that you are struggling with. This workshop is for any programmers that just need the environment for coding.

#### Collaborating in Project Making

In the computer science industry, experience in programming helps the most when applying for jobs. Companies are looking for how much programming knowledge the candidate has and how to apply it to projects. Therefore, creating this workshop for group projects can help your resume to look stronger.

#### Helping with finding and preparing for Computer Science field jobs

After making the perfect resume the next step is to prepare for job interviews. Such events that I plan to host can have hiring managers as guests from top companies. They will tell us what they are looking for in an interview, we can then use this knowledge to prepare for them. There can also be upper years which can guide you to success as well.

All of these events and activities are designed for all levels of coders in Carleton. I am here to help every first year in computer science to succeed.
