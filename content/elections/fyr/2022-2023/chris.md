Hi there! I’m Chris, and this fall I’m hoping to be elected as one of your First-Year Representatives! You’ll find some of the things I look forward to doing if I am elected listed in the points below. If you’d like to contact me, feel free to send me an email at christopherchallis@cmail.carleton.ca or send me a message on discord at CoffeeChris#9305.

### 📣 Represent all First-Years within the CCSS!

If I were to be elected as a First Year Representative my top priority would be to listen to and represent all of the interests, ideas, questions and concerns coming from the first-year students in the CCSS.

### 🗳️ A vote for First-Years’ interest!

I would ensure that each of the first-year members of the CCSS will have their voices represented during internal meetings when events and initiatives are being organized, and make sure that the first-year students have a vote when vital decisions are being made for the year.

### 🎉 Fun events and ways to get involved!

If elected, I would take the opportunity to organize fun events for first-year students. The aim of these events would be to get first-years involved and connected with CCSS and the larger computer science community at Carleton. The nature of these events would be influenced by the wider first-year body so that the events will appeal to everyone who wants to come out and participate.

### 📝 Academic support for CCSS members!

With the switch back to in-person learning, many are nervous about academics. During the busy and stressful exam seasons, I’d like to organize study or discussion groups to allow for effective review and give First-Years the opportunity to go over difficult concepts with others who are in the same boat.

### 🌐 Online support for those who want to get involved remotely!

Some First-Year members of the CCSS may be unable to be on campus. I’d aim to provide connection and involvement for First Year members of the CCSS remotely in order to ensure that they can be involved in the community even if they are unable to do so in person. 

### 📞 Open communication with other members!

In order to best represent first-year members, I’d keep myself available and open to feedback, ideas or any other things that first-year members may want to share with me. I’d do this in order to be and offer the best representation of the interest of first-years within the society.
