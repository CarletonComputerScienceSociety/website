Hello my name is Abdulla (or Abood) and i'm a first year CS student just like all of you. I am an international student that came from Qatar and really looking forward to getting the school year started as the first year rep for the CCSS! I enjoy basketball, football, gaming and anime so dont hesitate to say hi to me if you ever see me around campus. As for why I should be elected for the position:

<ul>

<li>
I am a social person so bridging the gap between the first years and upper year students is something that comes naturally and I would represent the collective mass of the first year CS students and voice their concerns and opinions.
</li>

<li>
I held executive positions at my school for many years so I know how to work from behind the scenes, ranging from planning activities to adjusting the budget to speaking in front of others, assuring that any events organized by me turn out to be great.
</li>

<li>
CS is an ever changing field and the CCSS has been a constant point, exisisting for 20+ years. I have a passion for the field of computer science,and using this passion to better the experience of other first year students and representing them would be a great honor.
</li>
</ul>

Once again I would like to thank you for reading my segment and I implore you to vote for me in the upcoming election. Regardless if you vote for me as your #1 candidate I wish you all the best of luck in the upcoming year :).
