Hey! My name is Sahil, and I’m running to be your First-Year rep at the CCSS!
Having oranised and participated in various hackathons, seminars and workshops, I’ve
concluded that the best way to grow as a professional in today’s tech scene is by developing
soft skills; something that a classroom environment often fails to deliver.
As a means to collectively work on our existing technical and interpersonal skills, I have
planned various activities if I’m elected as your first year rep. Some of them are:

- Create a tight-knit community among the CCSS members and forming life-long connections out of it!
- Bootcamps and Information Sessions for latest breakthroughs in various domains!
- Inviting industry experts to deliver lectures and mentor our fellow community members with tips to stand out from the crowd!
- Providing learning resources to members of varying skill levels to work on their
existing skillset.

Transitioning from high school to university has never been easy for anyone, let alone in an
online format. Let us all support one another, and LETS GET THAT BREAADDD!

Vote for Sahil Gagvani as your first year CCSS Rep! Trust me; you won’t regret it!

Thank you!
