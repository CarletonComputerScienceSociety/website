Hello everyone, I’m Shirley.Z and I’m running for CCSS’s first-year rep! I’m going to make this really short since I know everyone’s really busy. I have a lot of experience working in leadership positions in various clubs and councils(can vouch as someone who’s joined 9+ extracurriculars overall in high school) so I think I’ll fit this position perfectly. On top of that, I also really love drawing and if I’m voted, I’ll be sure to bring some artistic and creative ideas to CCSS events. And on top of all that, I’m 100% a cat person. If all that interests you, vote for me!
