Hi everybody, I’m Ari and I’m running for first year representative for the CCSS. As part of running my high school’s coding club I have experience teaching the ins and outs of object based programming and the skills for making cool projects. If I’m elected I hope to create more follow along workshops that would run people through making basic to advanced programs in an easy to understand way (I know I always get lost). I also want to provide a better platform for helping with classes.

Since I lack an interesting personality, here is a cool python game I’ve made. My high score is 324. What can you guys get?
