Let's make this short and sweet. I'm Thushen! In my past experiences working at RBC as an Innovation Developer, attending hackathons and running the Computer Science Club at my high school. I learned pure coding skills aren't enough. Networking is one of the most important skills to create opportunities, to learn and grow as an individual. This is what I have planned as your first year-representative:

- Create an active discussion on how to network and explain how it helps you make friends, learn knowledge fast and helps you land an internship!
- Host more networking events!
- Host beginner workshops in many tech-related categories such as Git, Socket.io and Android development.
- Move more CCSS events to [Gather Town](https://www.gather.town/?utm_term=gather%20town&utm_campaign=Branded%20Search_Gather%20Town&utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_content=499147839023&hsa_acc=5772092952&hsa_cam=12358653067&hsa_grp=121764253590&hsa_ad=499147839023&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-981544684057&hsa_kw=gather%20town&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtMCKBhDAARIsAG-2Eu9fmw4ThqtQhmJAl8YNSYalyedtwlDWCiwCB0bh_2XGeVOGq2YXU-AaAkWAEALw_wcB) to make a more interactive experience.
- Make some CCSS events in-person in the winter term as long as the School of Computer Science deems it is safe.

What is Gather Town? Gather Town is a web-conferencing software like Zoom, but with the added component of seeing the virtual “room” you and others are occupying, and with the ability to move around and interact with other participants based on your locations in the room, just like real life.

Dm me on Discord at Thushen#1418 if you have any questions or come find me during Dev Club in the CCSS Discord Server! I hope we have an amazing year.

This is the end of the platform. Thank you for letting me apply to be an First Year Representative.
