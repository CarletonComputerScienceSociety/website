Hi, Class of 2027! My name is Aidan Nelson.
If elected, I will advocate for 4 main initiatives:

### 1. Introductory Industry Events 💼

o More events like the industry mixer, for you to interact with potential employers and start building a professional network

o Presentations from older students in co-op, where you can address questions and concerns regarding the co-op process

o More presentations from people working in the computer science industry, for you to learn about networking and other aspects of the transition into a professional environment

### 2. Peer Study Sessions 📖

o Small class specific study groups, led by an older student

o This will provide a place to get help on class material and study for tests, midterms, and exams

o A great place to meet new friends and see classmates on a regular basis

### 3. Increased Accessibility to Academic Resources 💻

o Information and Q&A sessions with upper year students prior to course registration, mainly for new first year students

o I will work to improve online resources to provide better accessibility to course information for computer science students

o This will make the course selection process much easier and understandable

### 4. More Fun Events! 🍿

o Regularly hosted events, where you can stop by, meet new people, or bring some friends

o These will include board game nights, movie nights, and video games

o Any other event suggestions are encouraged!

Most importantly, as a first-year representative, it is my responsibility to ensure all of you are heard. Please contact me with any suggestions, questions, or concerns you may have.
