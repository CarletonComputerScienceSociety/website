Hello, my name is Jensen and I am hoping to become your first year representative. I would like to improve the **community, academics**, and **internship** side at Carleton CS.

### 🛎️Always willing to Network and Collaborate🛎️ (with great Friendliness👍):

You can always reach out to me if you would like to give me suggestions or collaborate with work. I am hoping to increase the activity of the Carleton community by hosting fun events where everyone could freely meetup.

### 📚Critical Group Study Sessions📚

I would host events where people within the same classes could attend to study and collaborate to get through important tests and assignments. During the events you could meet other students and elevate each other academically.

### 💵Internship & Job Experience Information Galleries💵

I would like to give students information through virtual galleries on gaining relevant coding experience and internship placements.

### 📝Project Development & Exhibition📝

In terms of getting internships, projects would be one of the most important things you would need. I will host a discord server where students and teachers could design and showcase projects.

### 😄A Friend😄

You can contact me almost anytime you like to study or just to hangout.
