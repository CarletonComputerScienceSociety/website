Hello everyone!
My name is Aditya but my friends call me Jacc. I’m an international student from India and while I’m not currently in a stream, I’m considering minors in Law and Physics. You may know me as the owner of the “Carleton Class of ‘27” discord server. I have been running informational and social events for incoming first-year students over the summer. I have also been volunteering with the CCSS for the last few months to create a new resources section of the CCSS website.

As a first-year student representative here is what I can do for you.

### 🧑‍🎓 Student-led presentations 🧑‍🎓

As first-year students, I’m sure you have questions about Carleton, and how future years of schooling will look. I plan to have some upper-year CS students hold presentations on a variety of topics such as co-op experience, internship experiences, and more. These events would be a great way to express concerns for the future and learn necessary skills for the future.

### 💻 CS opportunities at Carleton 💻

I plan to promote opportunities that will help students gain relevant experience through programs such as the DSRI, I-CUREUS and SaPP. I also wish to bring in people to share their experiences with these programs and advise those who wish to pursue these programs themselves.

### 📋 More volunteer opportunities for students 📋

I will create more volunteer opportunities and streamline the process of getting involved with the CCSS to allow more people to get CCR credit.  

### 🤝 Collaborating with other clubs for events 🤝

I will plan collaborative events with other Carleton clubs to add diversity to the events that the CCSS runs. This will create more volunteer opportunities for students. Lastly, it is a great way to meet people outside your social circle.

### 🎉 Interactive social events 🎉

I will host a variety of social events where students can socialize with each other, as well as personally talk to me about any suggestions or concerns they have in a casual setting.

In addition to these plans, I will also focus on:

Organizing group study sessions and creating more academic resources. 📚

Compiling a library of peer-reviewed online resources for self-learning. 🧠

Creating a fun learning environment for all computer science students! 💪
