Hello, fellow computer science first years! My name is Veronica Mordvinova, and I am very excited to run for the first-year representative position!

Before starting to talk about my plans for the upcoming year, and what I can do for you, let me tell you a little about myself, and the relevant experience that I have - that makes me the ideal candidate for the position

→ Experience representing the student body and their interests
2 years as secretary - student council

→ Experience planning events and organizing volunteers
3 years as a member of Key Club - 2.5 years as secretary

\
Now that you have that background, let’s get into the meat and potatoes of my platform!

### 1. Contacting, made easy

→ Issue: coming up to someone in a leadership position, outside of a formal context, may be intimidating to some people

→ Planned resolution

- Hanging around the CCSS lounge - come talk to me in person!
- Contact me via email! - <veronicamordvinova@cmail.carleton.ca>
- Contact me via discord! - username: macaroni4467  

### 2. Want to know what is going on?

→ Issue: while the CCSS already has a couple of outlets that announce events, and provide reminders, not everyone uses platforms like Instagram and Discord often enough to reap the benefits of these reminders

→ Resolution

- Shared Google Calendar - Google Calendar provides a visual representation of events, and provides the ability to receive reminders for events!
- Newsletter - as a student, you should (hopefully) be checking your email often enough to reap the benefits of a condensed overview of upcoming events - in one email!

### 3. No prior experience, no problem

→ Issue: certain first year students may have no coding experience, or may feel like they don’t have the “right” experience to be successful in class, or for internship/co-op applications

→ Resolution

- Workshops - providing a step-by-step guide to eliminate at least a bit of the guesswork
- Online course reviews - most of you have probably seen various online courses, and have been wondering which ones are worth your time to take - I would love to save you some time, and to the searching for you!

### 4. Feeling alone? Not anymore

→ Issue: because university is an entirely new environment for most people, and certain students may have moved away from their hometowns - it may be an isolating experience

→ Resolution

- Group study sessions - online, possibility of booking a group study room in the library
- Fun social events - movie nights, speed-friending, coffee chats and more!

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my platform, and I hope you have a great first year, regardless of who you end up voting for!
