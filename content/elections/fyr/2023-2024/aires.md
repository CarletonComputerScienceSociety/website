Hello everyone, I'm Aires. As the former president of my high school coding club, I sure do love coding. I'm from Toronto, so I knew no one when I first came here, but I like to spontaneously greet random people, so if you have no one to say hi to, I'll say hi to you.

### 💻Partnering With Other CS-Related Clubs💻

In most of our conversations with new people, the question of ""What stream are you in?"" usually pops up, and many have not decided yet. I will hold workshops with upper years to share their experience in different streams and partner with other more specific CS-related clubs to allow a better understanding of different programming fields.

### 👩‍🏫Connect With Professors and Seniors👩‍🏫

Talking to professors and seniors can be intimidating, and sparking a conversation with them might feel unnatural. I will hold events to help you build connections with professors and upper years, and hopefully, they'll become one of your references.

### 📚Academic Support📚

It can be confusing to figure out how to write notes for different classes and how to time manage, so I will hold events on different study techniques upper years have seen success in. No one explains a concept better than another student who already understands it. I will also organize study groups to help struggling students and to help you make new connections.

### 🤝Creating a More Welcoming Environment for Women🤝

At every CCSS meeting I have attended, there is an overwhelming amount of guys compared to girls. I will create a more comfortable environment for students who identify as a woman by inviting professors to chat about their professional careers and the obstacles they've come across as women. I will also partner with other women-related clubs to build an inclusive environment.

### 🍕Make New Friends🍕

Don't fall into the computer science stereotype of spending all your time studying away and forgoing a social life! I will organize activities such as trivia, games, and movie night, and don't worry, there will be food.

Come say hi! (or I'll say hi to you)
