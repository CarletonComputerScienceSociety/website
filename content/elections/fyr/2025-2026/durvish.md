### ✨ Quick Synopsis (aka summary of why you should vote for me):

🎤 Q&A with seniors → real advice, not Google answers.

🎮 Fun events → game nights, coding jams, study squads.

💼 Co-op/internships → less stress, more confidence.

🚀 Hackathons & Recruiters → skills, networks, and building memories.

❤️ A first-year experience that’s not just about *surviving* but *thriving*.

### __Full Platform:__ 
**If elected as First-Year Representative**, my priority would be to make sure that every first-year student feels **heard, supported, and connected** within the Computer Science community. Starting university can feel overwhelming, from navigating deadlines to understanding co-op and internships, and I want to be the *bridge* that ensures none of us face these challenges alone.

One of my first initiatives will be to organize an **open Q&A with upper-year students** who’ve successfully gone through what we’re starting. These sessions will let us ask candid questions about academics, co-op applications, career building, and even personal well-being. Think of it as *“Office Hours: Unfiltered”*, real stories, real advice.

*Also, because I consider all of us to be one big family*, at no point do I think I’m in charge! *To have your voice heard*, I’ll **set up polls for voting, so you choose what happens and which events are held!** Additionally, I’ll keep an **open suggestion form** for ideas you’d like done, and if possible, I’ll make them happen.

Furthermore, since community is at the heart of my platform, I want us to feel connected as people, beyond academics. I’d work with CCSS to create **casual social events**, game nights, coding challenges, and open drop-ins where friendships are built (because our first year should be full of memories). University is as much about *relationships* as it is about lectures, and I want to ensure every student finds their place here.

Another key goal is to make the **co-op and internship process less intimidating**. I’ll connect us with workshops, alumni, and resources on résumés, interviews, and finding roles that match our interests. I also want to spotlight opportunities like **hackathons, coding competitions, and research projects**, places to apply what we learn in class to real-world problems while building our skills and networks. 

In short, if elected, I’ll make our first year not just *manageable* but *meaningful*. I’ll be an advocate for clarity in academics and career pathways, a voice for our concerns, and a leader who fosters community and inclusivity.

Together, we can make this year, one where we not only learn computer science but also discover how strong we can be as a community ❤ ️.
