Hi everyone, I am Rudraksh Sharma, a fellow first year at Carleton University. I am in the
Bachelors in Comp Sci Program with an AI/ML Stream and am running for First Year
Computer Science Rep!!

Now, I won’t ask for your votes (well not in the way everyone else does it), but rather, I just
want some of your valuable time. Time, to read this and understand the vision I hold for our
First Year memories that are yet to be made. Time, to communicate and let me know if there
are changes you want to make in my plans, and then at last, time, to vote, only if you
consider my ideas to be fruitful and interesting.

The reasons that you should vote for me (not to brag or anything), are many, but, rather than
me going on for days on days, I would just list some of my ideas in a nutshell below –

### 🎤 First-Year Talent Show: *“Fresher of the Week”*
A platform for us to showcase our hidden talents — from music and dance to
stand-up and spoken word or even your own coded fun projects. At the end, one
performer will be crowned **Fresher of the Year!** There will be music, a chill place to
hang out with friends, and LOADS of good vibes.

### 💬 A First-Year Community Hub
Whether it’s a Discord or group chat, I’ll create a space where first-years can stay
connected, share resources, ask questions, and build friendships outside the
classroom.

### 🎮 Bi-weekly/Monthly Board Games and Game Nights
Fresher’s mixers that will be arranged at places all over the campus with engaging
games to get to know each other better and know people from our own program to
chill out with and make connections with.

### 🎓 Specialised time with Seniors outside TA hours
Have doubts that need to be cleared? Or just don’t know what to do in that one
assignment? You can ask the seniors who have been through the same classes just
a year or few ago and get their opinions on your codes/problems!!

### 📚 Outdoor Activities, Walks, Sports
I’ll organise outdoor walks, sports tournaments and picnics whenever the weather
suits it, so that everyone can chill and enjoy their time here at Carleton.
