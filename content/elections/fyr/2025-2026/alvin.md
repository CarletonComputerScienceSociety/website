First year CS may feel like being thrown into the deep end for a lot a people. You have assignments piling up like Jenga - COMP1405, MATH 1007, COMP1805, etc. and yet you are expected to maintain a social life? Yeah, but no thank you.

If I'm a first-year representative, I want the entire experience to be less about "why is this happening to me?" and more like, "y'know what... It's not too bad..."

My goal is pretty simple: be the best representative for y'all and the guy who you can DM when you have a great idea that could make things better!

Here's my game plan:
- <u>**Gamified First-Year Engagement:**</u> A leaderboard system, that updates every week with points earned from weekly coding challenges, attending events, and participating in hackathons! Top leaderboard finishers in first year will earn CCSS merch, gift cards and/or resume review priority!
- <u>**Monthly polls**</u> where everyone can say what's working, what sucks, what events would you like to see, etc.
- <u>**Resume help system**</u> will help you further your career! In this economy, computer science jobs are hard to come by. Why not get ahead of the crowd and get super valuable advice on your resumes!?
- <u>**Chill events**</u> that aren't just coding 24/7! - Board game nights, movie watch parties, maybe even have a __FIFA World Cup watch party!__ (Go Canada!)
- <u>**I am YOUR representative!**</u> You have a grievance? Want suggest an idea? I'll always be online to answer y'all queries!

I just don't want first year to be about surviving until second year, and on and on and on! I want it to be fun, social and helpful for all! Everybody, especially first-year students, should progress with friends, connections, memories, and maybe even get an internship! (not just get a crippling caffeine addiction lol)

soo yeah - vote for **ALVIN KAPOOR** and let's make this year a year we all thrive, and not just survive!
