Hey everyone! My name is Megh, and I'm a first year Computer Science Honours student. Starting university will be exciting as well as can be overwhelming, so I want to help make the first year fun and supportive for new students.

So, here's what I plan to do if I am elected as a First Year Representative:

### Study Sessions:
I'll organize study sessions before midterms and final exams, so we can study in a group and discuss any problems and also will have study sessions with our peers so that we can connect with peers, learn some new things and share any tips.

### Workshops/Bootcamps:
I'll plan bootcamps in which we will learn different programming languages, git, linux and some basic fundamental concepts.

### Event Updates:
I'll share all the events updates weekly on discord, instagram and on the ccss website also so that you join and have fun.

### Movie/Game Nights:
Learning is important I know but some fun is also necessary I will also organize movie nights, outdoor group walks, trivia nights and game nights with snacks.

### Career talks:
I will also organize career talks by industry professionals and upper year students sharing their experience and how you can make the most of it.

Also if have questions or any suggestions, events ideas or proposals then feel free to reach out to me :)
