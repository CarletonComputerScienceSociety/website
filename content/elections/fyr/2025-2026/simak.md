### About Me
My name is Simak Safwan, and Iâ€™m running to be your CCSS First-Year Representative. I live in Ottawa and graduated from high school here.

### Why You Should Vote For Me
- I bring leadership experience from high school as a **Link Crew Leader, Vice-President of the MEDLIFE Club, and Yearbook Design Lead**, as well as through involvement with other student groups where I represented my peers.

- I will ensure that first-year voices are heard in the CCSS and that your ideas, concerns, and interests are brought forward to the governing body of the society.

- I will be committed to building a stronger community by creating opportunities for first-years to connect with each other and with upper-year students through CCSS events and initiatives tailored for first-years specifically, making our transition to university smoother, more exciting, and more engaging.

I would be honoured to serve as your First-Year Representative! Feel free to reach out to me on my socials if you have any questions.
