Hey! **I'm Aidan and I'm starting in the new Bachelor of Cybersecurity program.**

As a first year representative my primary goal will be to continue building the CCSS community by creating as many opportunities as possible for other first year students to engage with the society and make connections with their peers and upper year students alike. I'm especially interested in ensuring that the CCSS is able to host many events where members can learn, practice, and demonstrate programming and other technical skills. Additionally, I want to continue the society's work in collecting and making accessible resources which can help members progress academically and professionally with confidence.

As a cybersecurity student, I have the right perspective to help the CCSS support and incorporate the new program and its students. I'll be on the lookout for opportunities that allow both B.Cyber and Comp Sci students to dive deeper into their subject matter and develop skills outside of their classes.

Ultimately, I'm excited to foster a community that is not only welcoming to all new students, but also provides ample opportunity to become more engaged and receive support while we work through our first year of study.

I'm always happy to hear suggestions or just chat, so feel free to say hi in person or message me on **Discord, where my username is csilarion.**
