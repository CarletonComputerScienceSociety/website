Hey everyone!! If I am elected, I promise to give it my all to debug the first-year issues, because problems deserve solutions, not crashes (we get enough of those writing code anyways). My name is Krisha and I’m super excited to be running for your First-Year Representative for the Carleton Computer Science Society!

### ACADEMIC SUPPORT AND FUTURE EVENTS:
Even within our first month, tests and assignments are already piling up, which can feel really overwhelming. I swear my CS lecture feels like people are scared to sit within a 10-foot radius of each other. Let’s break that anti-social CS student stereotype. 

We can host fun social events and create spaces to meet new people, and build friendships outside the classroom. 
- Weekly study groups
- Game nights
- Movie nights
- Coding competitions
- Hangouts

All of this would help make the workload a little easier, and by sharing updates through Email, Discord, and Instagram no one will miss out on anything.

### MY EXPERIENCE: 
3 years as captain of my school’s dance team taught me how to lead and motivate others. Likewise, being president of my school’s Athletic Council made me responsible for organizing events and activities for the whole student body, similar to what the CCSS does.

These roles have taught me all the skills I need to represent your voices, plan fun and useful events, and foster community here at Carleton.
