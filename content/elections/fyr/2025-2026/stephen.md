Hi, Iâ€™m Stephen.

As your representative, I will help organize events featuring math-based coding challenges. These will be similar to Math Olympiad questions but less difficult, making them very interesting for anyone who enjoys coding and mathematics.

### Introducing you to Coding Challenges
If you are familiar with LeetCode, you can expect questions in a similar style. I also draw inspiration from platforms like Codeforces and AtCoder, which tend to be more math-heavy. LeetCode is known for technical interview preparation, whereas these other platforms are better for developing strong mathematical problem-solving skills. Below are some links to example problems. Take a look to see if you enjoy them! (Note: These can be very hard for beginners, but problems are ranked by difficulty.)
1.	[Problem - 2148A - Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2148/A)<br/>

2.	[Problem - 2139B - Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2139/B)<br/>

### Why This is Important For You
This type of coding challenge is often called competitive programming. It is highly beneficial and can help you advance in two key areas:
1. **Conquering FAANG-style interviews:** The five [FAANG](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp) companies popularized this interview format, which has become a standard in the software engineering industry.
2. **Admission to world-renowned institutions:** The University of Waterloo, which has one of the best computer science programs in Canada, considers performance in contests like the Euclidean Contest and the Canadian Computing Contest during its enrollment process.

### My Qualifications
I have solved approximately 1,300 questions on LeetCode, with the average problem being more complex than the examples above. My current LeetCode contest rating is 2114, which places me in the top 1.42% of competitive programmers worldwide.

If this interests you and you want to learn more about these coding challenges, please vote for me in the election. Feel free to contact me to discuss them further at [StephenSun@cmail.carleton.ca](mailto:StephenSun@cmail.carleton.ca). I look forward to connecting with others who share the same passion!
