### Why I’m Running 🏃💨:
- First year is exciting… and slightly terrifying.
- Five classes, 300-page lecture slides, and trying to make friends? Yeah, it’s chaos.
- I don’t want anyone going through this alone.

### Your Voice Matters 🎤:
- If there’s one thing I care about besides a 12.0 GPA , it’s making sure you’re heard.
- Heavy workloads? Confusing assignments?
- Or just praying for a “For Dummies” version of the course content—I got you.

### Building Community 🐐:
- Lecture halls are packed and awkward, its difficult to meet smart nerds like us
- Thats where I swoop in faster then LEBRONN and I’ll create study groups, night coding sessions, and chill hangouts and etc.
- Basically, spaces where we can rant about assignments or just… not talk about coding for once.(yay :D)

### Approachable & Supportive 😎🦸:
- A rep shouldn’t just sit in meetings—they should be there for you.
- Struggling, lost, or want to spend three hours talking about... idk man?
- I’m your guy.

### My Promise 🧞🫖:
- Keep everyone in the loop.
- Make our first year smoother, more fun, and way less stressful.
- Help us survive COMP 1805… with at least some sanity left.
