### [üôã Who am I?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TaO9ZCaIJNsCXq8p9FYL6J938fYfMmQ7/view)
Hey! I‚Äôm Jack, a first-year Computer Science student in the Cybersecurity stream running to be
your representative. To be brief, my goal is to make our first year more **connected** by creating
opportunities to meet new people, build friendships, and support each other academically. I want
to foster a **community** where students feel included, engaged, and able to grow together.

Below are some highlights from my platform. If you want a more detailed copy, please reference
my **[manifesto](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TaO9ZCaIJNsCXq8p9FYL6J938fYfMmQ7/view).**

### [ü§úü§õ Promoting Community](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TaO9ZCaIJNsCXq8p9FYL6J938fYfMmQ7/view)
I will organize friendly **events** like coffee chats, social activities, and game nights including
activities such as laser tag and capture the flag. These events will give students the chance to
**connect** outside of class, form friendships, and make the transition to university life easier. A
stronger community also leads to stronger academics, since it‚Äôs easier to study together, share
resources, and **collaborate** with each other.

### [üí¶üå± Academic Support](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TaO9ZCaIJNsCXq8p9FYL6J938fYfMmQ7/view)
Instead of solely relying on **mentorship** from upper years, my goal is to move towards a more
accessible peer support-based system. This includes creating a first-year **tutoring** system
where students who are confident in certain subjects can volunteer to help others, forming
regular **study groups**, as well as organizing drop-in study sessions before midterms and
exams. I also want to connect students with existing **resources** such as academic advisors, TA
office hours, and online communities.

### [üï∏Ô∏è Networking](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TaO9ZCaIJNsCXq8p9FYL6J938fYfMmQ7/view)
Building **connections** is as important as personal connections. Putting your foot in the door as
early as possible is a strong step to take towards building your **career**. I will organize events
that **professionally** connect us with alumni and industry professionals. The events will include
alumni panels, workshops, and resume clinics.

### [‚úä Pledge to Action](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TaO9ZCaIJNsCXq8p9FYL6J938fYfMmQ7/view)
As your representative, I pledge to listen to your ideas and bring forth an **ever-adapting** plan of
action built to strengthen our **community.**
