### Introduction
Hey everyone!!! Iâ€™m Sofia, and Iâ€™m a first-year student here at Carleton! Iâ€™m studying computer science, stream: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. AI to me is really interesting and I would love to learn more about it. As you may all know, AI might have unpleasant consequences on our future, however, I believe that it has the power to change the world for the better and I would like to be part of that change!

### First-Year Experience
As a CCSS first-year representative candidate, I deeply understand how confusing and overwhelming, yet exciting, this new stage of our lives is. As a first year, many things are very different: lecture styles, lessons, campus life, meeting new people, professorsâ€™ teaching styles, living in residence, managing finances, time management, and many many more.

### Priorities and Ideas
That being said, it would be my priority to make sure that every first-year studentâ€™s voice is heard and their needs are met. Some of my many ideas include:
- learning how to manage your time
- how to stay organized
- how to achieve the best grades in your classes

This would best be achieved by connecting with upper-year peers. My goal is to connect as many first-year students to upper-year students who are in computer science as well. Another event is having a meet and greet with CS professors. This would not only make you have a deeper connection with your professor but could also benefit you in the long run, like in research projects or in becoming a teaching assistant (TA).

### Women in CS
Moreover, as a woman, I understand how male-dominated the CS field is. With that in mind, some activities that I would make to foster a good, encouraging, environment for women in STEM include having a panel for women where profs and industry women share their journeys with everyone. As well as have a fun Q&A + snacks in order to get useful tips and advice. Iâ€™m committed to ensuring that womenâ€™s voices are heard and acknowledged through the various opportunities that would take place.

### Co-op Support
Furthermore, Co-op is another huge step in your life. I know how confusing and frustrating it could sound. Where do you start? Where do you look? How to get prepared? All of these questions would guarantee an answer through attending my meetups where you could further expand your communication and networking skills.

### Excited to Meet Everyone!
I will always be more than happy to hear from you! Whether itâ€™s suggestions for events, seeking connections, or if you simply just want someone that shares your interests in CS!

We, as first-yearâ€™s CS students, will rock this year and all the years to come!
