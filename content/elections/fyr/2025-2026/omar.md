Hey everyone!
My name is **Omar, and I'm in the Bachelor of Cybersecurity.** I'm super excited to run to be one of your First Year Representatives.

The transition from high school to university is one that is equal parts abrupt, hard and exciting. My goal is to smooth out that transition as best as I possibly could for all of us.

As your First Year Rep., here's what I'll do for you:

1. Serve as a direct point-of-contact between you and the CCSS, making sure any comments concerns or questions you have are heard and addressed by the Board of Directors.

2. Organize a social event for first years in Computer Science and Cybersecurity to meet each other, because I know how hard it is to break out of your bubble and make new friends.

3. Organize study sessions to prepare for midterms and exams, where we're all able to share knowledge, receive feedback from each other and work together to solve more complex problems.

If you'd like to reach out to me regarding my campaign or if you'd just like to chat, feel free to reach out to me via email at [OmarDahman@cmail.carleton.ca](mailto:OmarDahman@cmail.carleton.ca).
