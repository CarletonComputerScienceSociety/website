When trying to figure out which electives might be best for you - there are a few things that you might want to consider. Whether that might be making the best use of your breadth and free electives, getting a minor, or strategically planning your electives to be able to take online courses during the summer, there are a lot of options for Computer Science students!

Before we get started - you can find the complete list of course offerings [here](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/courses/). Also be sure to check the list of [prohibited courses](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/undergradprograms/computerscience/#text:~:text=Course%20Categories%20(B.C.S.)) that cannot be used for credit in the Computer Science program.

### Take Courses Based on Your Interests
When planning your electives, make sure that you are **selecting courses that genuinely interest you**, and not just “bird” courses (courses that you think will be easy). While it is tempting to select electives based on their difficulty, as opposed to anything else, you might get stuck in a course that you find uninteresting or that you dislike the material of, and struggle to complete assessments because of it.

Another consideration is that **you can only take up to 7.0 credits of 1000-level courses**, including mandatory classes. If you end up liking a course, and it is a prerequisite for a subsequent series of courses that is 2000-level or above, you can take those courses and avoid going past that limit.

When else will you be in a setting that encourages you to explore different interests through courses taught by experts in those fields?

<br/>

### Consider Adding a Minor to Your Degree
A BCS student can **add up to 2 program elements**, which can be a combination of minors and streams, and the degree has enough elective credits to complete any minor. If you have any interests outside of CS, or would like to do courses that complement it, you should consider [getting a minor](https://admissions.carleton.ca/minors/)!

<br/>

### Strategic Elective Planning
Do you plan to do courses during the summer or during your co-op terms? Some courses are often offered online, and some are even offered “unscheduled” (meaning that there are no scheduled lecture times). 

These courses are good to “save” for co-op terms, as these courses can be done after work hours, and if you are in a different city - there is a chance that evaluations will be accessible as well!

### Common Electives for CS Students
If you’re looking for a place to start planning your electives, consider looking into the following common elective choices: 
- CGSC 1001 - Mysteries of the Mind
   - If you want to learn how computer science concepts like AI work at a high level, and how it applies to studying the working mind
- LING 1001 - Introduction to Linguistics I
- LING 1100 - Mysteries of Language
   - If you are interested in language processing (a subset of AI!)
- PHIL 2001 - Introduction to Logic
   - If formal logic and proofs interest you
- PHIL 2003 - Critical Thinking
   - If you are interested in critical reasoning and logical patterns of thought
   - Both PHIL 2001 and 2003 also overlap in content with COMP 1805 (Discrete Strucutures I), which is a required course for our degree. 


#### Other Common Electives
If you **liked biology in high school:**
- BIOL 1010 - Biotechnology and Society
