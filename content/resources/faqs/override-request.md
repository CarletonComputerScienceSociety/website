If you receive any registration warnings or are unable to register for a course, you may submit a [registration override request](https://carleton.ca/registrar/registration/override-requests/) [1] to get permission to register for the course. However, these requests are reviewed on a case by case basis and are not guaranteed to be approved. 

In order to submit an override request, you must first attempt to register and receive an error preventing you from registration. You can then submit a registration override request on Carleton Central. For a step-by-step guide, check out [this video](https://central.carleton.ca/prod/pkg_online_CROS.p_trmsel) [2].
