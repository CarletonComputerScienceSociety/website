If you get any registration warnings or canâ€™t enroll in a course, you may submit a [registration override request](https://carleton.ca/registration/override-requests/) for permission to register. However, these **requests are reviewed on a case by case basis** and are not guaranteed to be approved. 

In order to submit an override request, you must **first attempt to register and receive an error** preventing you from registration. You can then submit a registration override request on Carleton Central. For a step-by-step guide, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWo_IGIEpVE).
