You can take any course offered at Carleton as an elective, except for a few [prohibited courses](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/courses/). The complete list of subjects and courses offered can be found [here](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/courses/).

You must complete both your [breadth and free elective](https://carleton.ca/scs/current-students/undergraduate-students/help-selecting-courses/electives-and-prohibited-courses/) credits to satisfy your degreeâ€™s requirements.
