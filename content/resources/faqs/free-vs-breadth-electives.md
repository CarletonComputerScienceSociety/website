**Breadth Electives cannot** be under **COMP, MATH, STAT, CSEC, DATA or Engineering**, or on the list of **[prohibited courses](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/undergradprograms/computerscience/#text:~:text=Course%20Categories%20(B.C.S.))**. After you fulfill your breadth elective requirement, courses that would have counted towards your breadth requirement begin to count as free electives.

"Breadth Electives are all of the courses offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Public and Global Affairs, the Sprott School of Business, and the Faculty of Science. This excludes prohibited courses (see below) and all courses in Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Math and Statistics, and courses under the Faculty of Engineering and Design." [2]

**Free Electives** can be **any course that is not prohibited**. These may be used to take more breadth courses, or additional COMP, MATH and STAT courses that are not required for your degree.

"Free Electives are all courses in Approved Arts, Social Sciences, Science, Business, Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Math and Statistics, excluding all prohibited courses (see below). Engineering courses can also count as Free Electives, but never Breadth." [2]

**NOTE:** *Computer Science students cannot register for CSEC or DATA courses. However, if you took these courses before transferring into Computer Science, they will be considered free electives.*
