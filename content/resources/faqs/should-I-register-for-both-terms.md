Yes, you are strongly encouraged to **register for your fall and winter semester courses as soon as your [time ticket](https://carleton.ca/registration/dates/timetickets/) opens**. Even if you arenâ€™t sure about which courses you want to take, you should tentatively register in some courses to avoid losing your spot if they fill up. 

It is **possible to switch or drop courses** until the first few weeks of each semester. For specific deadlines related to course registration, check out the [academic calendar](https://students.carleton.ca/academic-dates/).
