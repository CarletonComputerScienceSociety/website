There is **no difference in content** between COMP 1005/1006 and COMP 1405/1406. For example, COMP 1005 A and COMP 1405 A are the **exact same course**, with the same lectures and instructor. 

The only difference is who the courses are intended for:
- **COMP 1005/1006** are for **students in other programs** that are interested in taking these courses as an elective. 
- **COMP 1405/1406** are for **students in the Bachelor of Computer Science** program.

As a Computer Science student, you should **register in COMP 1405 and 1406.**
