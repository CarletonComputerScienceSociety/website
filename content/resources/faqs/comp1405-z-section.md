The Z section is an **accelerated version of COMP 1405 and COMP 1406**, which allows you to complete both of them in the fall semester. COMP 1405 Z runs during the first half of the semester and COMP 1406 Z runs during the second half of the semester. It is important to note that the Z section is **not a separate course**, it is just a different section of both COMP 1405 and COMP 1406.

The learning outcomes and topics covered are the same as the standard versions of these courses, but they are covered in half as much time. It is recommended that you have some **prior programming experience** in order to ensure that you are able to keep up with the pace of the course.

To register for the Z section, you should either be a **Shopify Dev Degree** (1) student or have an **admission average of 90%** or higher. You must also submit an **override request** (2) to get permission to register.
