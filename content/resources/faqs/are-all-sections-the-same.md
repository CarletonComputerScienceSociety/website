While the **learning outcomes** and core content of a course are the **same across all sections**, there may be a few **minor differences**. Different instructors may have different grade breakdowns, assignment and test schedules, and slight differences in the order or focus of the course content.

Other differences between sections may include the [section type](https://carleton.ca/registration/course-delivery-types/) (e.g., in-person vs. online, scheduled vs. unscheduled), class times, or their location on campus. 

An **exception to this is the [1405/1406 Z section](/resources/faqs/comp1405-z-section/)**, which covers the same content as other sections but at twice the speed, allowing you to complete both courses within the fall semester.
