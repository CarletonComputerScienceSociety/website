While the learning outcomes and core content of a course are the same across all sections, there may be a few minor differences. Different instructors may have different grade breakdowns, assignment and test schedules, and slight differences in the order or focus of the course content.

Other differences between sections may include the [section type](https://carleton.ca/registration/course-delivery-types/) [1] (e.g., in-person vs. online, scheduled vs. unscheduled), class times or their location on campus. 

An exception to this is the [1405/1406 Z section](https://ccss.carleton.ca/resources/faqs/comp1405-z-section/) [2], which covers the same content as other sections but at twice the speed, allowing you to complete both courses within the fall semester.
