Registration for **incoming first year students** opens between **July 2nd and July 4th, 2025**. Returning **upper-year students** can begin registering for courses **between July 8th and July 11th, 2025.**

The exact time that you can start registering for courses depends on your [time ticket](https://carleton.ca/registration/dates/timetickets/), which can be found in the “getting started” section of the registration menu in Carleton Central. 

Note that while it is strongly recommended that you register for courses as soon as your time ticket opens, it is possible to make registration changes until a few weeks into the semester. For specific deadlines related to adding or dropping courses, check out the [academic calendar](https://students.carleton.ca/academic-dates/).
