It is normal for some courses to be listed without an instructor. 

If it’s a lecture, it may be taught by a contract instructor who hasn’t been assigned yet, or the teaching assignments may not be finalized until closer to the start of the semester.
If it’s a tutorial, it may be led by a teaching assistant, which is why no instructor is listed.

Make sure you don’t wait for an instructor to be assigned before registering, as courses may fill up by then.
