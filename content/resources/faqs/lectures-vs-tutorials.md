**Lectures** are the main part of a course **where your instructor covers the course material**. It is also common for midterms to take place during the lecture time slot.  

**Tutorials** are additional sessions led by teaching assistants that are meant to **supplement your learning**, such as with practical exercises or short quizzes. The **exact format of a tutorial varies between courses** and will be explained in the course outline. 

If a course has a tutorial, you **must register for both a lecture section as well as an associated tutorial section.**
