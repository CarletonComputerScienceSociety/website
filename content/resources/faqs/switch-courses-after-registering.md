Yes, it is **possible to switch courses until the first few weeks of each semester.** For specific deadlines related to adding and dropping courses, check out the [academic calendar](https://students.carleton.ca/academic-dates/). 

If a course is full, you may be able to join a [waitlist](https://carleton.ca/registration/waitlisting/) (if one is available). Register for an alternative course in the meantime, and switch into your preferred course later if a spot opens.

Itâ€™s also **common for students to make changes to their schedules at the start of each semester.** We recommend checking back regularly to see if a spot opens up in a course that was previously full.
