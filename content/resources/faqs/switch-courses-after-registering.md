Yes, it is possible to switch or drop courses up to the first few weeks of each semester. For specific deadlines related to course registration, check out the [academic calendar](https://students.carleton.ca/academic-dates/) [1]. 

If a course is full, you may be able to join a [waitlist](https://carleton.ca/registration/waitlisting/) [2] (if one is available), register for an alternative course in the meantime, and switch into your preferred course later if a spot opens.

Itâ€™s also common for students to make changes to their schedules at the start of each semester. We recommend checking back regularly to see if a spot opens up in a course you were interested in that was previously full.
