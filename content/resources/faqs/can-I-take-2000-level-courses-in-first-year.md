Yes, it may be possible to take 2000-level or higher courses if you meet the requirements. Registering for a course depends on prerequisite requirements such as having a passing grade in certain other courses, or meeting a certain [year standing](https://carleton.ca/academicadvising/year-standing/) [1]. You can find these requirements in the courseâ€™s description in the [undergraduate calendar](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/courses/) [2].

It may be possible to submit a [registration override request](https://carleton.ca/registration/override-requests/) [3] to register in a course without meeting the prerequisites; however these requests are reviewed on a case by case basis and are not guaranteed to be approved.
