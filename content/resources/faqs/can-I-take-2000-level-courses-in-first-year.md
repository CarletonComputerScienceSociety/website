Yes, you may be able to take some 2000-level or higher courses if you **meet the prerequisite requirements**. Registering for a course depends on prerequisites such as having a passing grade in certain other courses, or meeting a certain [year standing](https://carleton.ca/academicadvising/year-standing/). You can find these requirements in the **courseâ€™s description in the [undergraduate calendar](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/courses/)**.

It may be possible to submit a [registration override request](https://carleton.ca/registration/override-requests/) to register in a course without meeting the prerequisites; however, these requests are reviewed on a case by case basis and are not guaranteed to be approved.
