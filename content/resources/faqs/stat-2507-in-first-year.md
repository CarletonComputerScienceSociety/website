Taking STAT 2507 in your first year can help reduce your second-year workload, which could include as many as seven required 2000-level courses for Computer Science students. [1]

The course also covers **concepts that overlap with COMP 2804** (Discrete Structures II), so taking STAT 2507 beforehand can make COMP 2804 slightly easier.

Alternatively, since STAT 2507 isnâ€™t a prerequisite for any other required COMP courses, you can also choose to delay it until third year if you prefer a lighter first-year schedule.
