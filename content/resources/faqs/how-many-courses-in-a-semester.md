Generally, the course load for full-time students is 2.5 credits per term (usually 5 courses). However, many students choose to take a reduced course load, for a variety of reasons. Anecdotally, it is fairly common for students to take 2.0 credits or 4 courses per semester to have a lighter workload. 

We recommend that you reach out to an [academic advisor](https://carleton.ca/academicadvising/) [1] to discuss your specific situation before making a decision about how many courses to take. Taking a reduced course load could have an impact on the following: 

- Your status as a full time student 
- Tuition costs
- Residence eligibility
- Scholarship eligibility and government funding (for example OSAP) 
- Co-op eligibility
- Visas and study permits (for international students)
