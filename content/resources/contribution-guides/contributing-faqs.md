## 4. Write the answer

- FAQs are intended to summarise relevant information as concisely as possible. Try to stick to **100-200 words**. 
- Don't rewrite things that have already been explained by the School of Computer Science or Carleton University webpages. You can include a short summary or quote and then link to their webpages.
- The ticket on the project board corresponding to your FAQ will highlight some information that should be covered by your answer.

## 5. Format your answer with markdown

If you are not familiar with markdown, check out [Github's guide for markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

You can refer to a completed FAQ file to get an idea of how to include links
