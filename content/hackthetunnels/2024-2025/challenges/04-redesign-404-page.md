For this challenge, your team needs to improve the "[404](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404) Page". 

This is the page that renders whenever you try to go to a route that does not exist in your app, ex: `"http://localhost:5173/idontexist"`.

Checkout: [`client/src/pages/NotFound/NotFound.tsx`](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/hack-the-tunnels-starter-2024/blob/main/client/src/pages/NotFound/NotFound.tsx) to get started.

<br/>

## Acceptance Criteria:

The new page must have more than just the text "404".

If you can't think of any better improvements, just put a funny gif or something you feel represents the goal of this page.

Bonus points are allowed to be given if it is obvious the team has put significant effort into overhauling the 404 page.
