Enhance the **styling** of the "course results" on the BuildTimetable. 

This refers to the ui that displays search results for scheduled events. 

This can involve improving layout, colors, spacing, and overall design to improve clarity and visual appeal for students searching through results.

<br/>

## Acceptance Criteria:

- The styling of the course search results are significantly different

(so long as it looks pretty different you can give them the points)
