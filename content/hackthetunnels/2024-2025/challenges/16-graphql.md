Create a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API for the service. This GraphQL API will be exposed on the route `POST /api/graphql`.

To satisfy this challenge, implement at least one GraphQL query and one GraphQL mutation. Be sure to reuse the existing service code within the `service/src/services` folder to integrate with your GraphQL implementation.

If you're not sure where to get started, check out this [guide.](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/)

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. A GraphQL API is set up and accessible at the specified route.
2. At least one query and one mutation are implemented successfully.
3. The participant reuses existing service code appropriately to handle the GraphQL operations.
