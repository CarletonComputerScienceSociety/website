Using the provided [Prisma schema file](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/hack-the-tunnels-starter-2024/blob/main/service/src/db/schema.prisma), create a [Entity Relationship diagram](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html) using [`mermaid.js`](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html).

Your diagram should model the relationships between the different entities, including their attributes and how they connect (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).

<br/>

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. The schema diagram should represent each entity from the provided schema file and at least one relationship between entities.
2. Use Mermaid.js to clearly depict the relationships between tables (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.).
3. The diagram does not need to match every attribute, but core relationships and entities should be represented.
