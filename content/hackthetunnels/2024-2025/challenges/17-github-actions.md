Create a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) configuration that runs Prettier automatically whenever a pull request (PR) is made. The action should format the code in the specified files to maintain code style consistency across the project.

Ensure that your workflow is triggered on `pull_request` events and that it runs Prettier on the designated files or directories.

See an [example of this](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/website/blob/master/.github/workflows/workflow.yml) on the CCSS Website repo.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. A GitHub Actions workflow is created that runs Prettier on PRs.
2. The workflow triggers correctly when a pull request is opened or updated.
