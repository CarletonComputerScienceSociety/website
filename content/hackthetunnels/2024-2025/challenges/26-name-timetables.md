Add functionality to allow users to **save a custom name** for their timetables. This will help users identify their timetables more easily when managing multiple schedules.

In the client, create an input field on the **BuildTimetable** page where users can enter a name for their timetable.

Update the `createTimetable` method to use the input from that input field.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. A text input field is added on the BuildTimetable page where users can enter a name for their timetable.
2. The name is saved in the backend when the timetable is created or updated.
3. The saved name is displayed when viewing or managing timetables.
