Add a way on the "BuildTimetable" page for a student to request a course recommedntation based on a time and day specified by the student.

When a user requests a recommendation, the system should return a list of available courses that fit within that time frame.

To query the backend, you can either add new [query parameters](https://www.branch.io/glossary/query-parameters/#:~:text=Query%20parameters%20are%20a%20defined,web%20server%20when%20making%20requests.) to the `/scheduledEvents` endpoint or create a new endpoint.

In terms of how this is presented to users, you are welcome to have it be as simple or as complex as you want. (It can just be a couple input boxes).

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. The feature successfully accepts a time input from the user.
2. The system returns a list of recommended courses that fit the specified time and days.
3. The recommendation logic handles potential scheduling conflicts appropriately.
