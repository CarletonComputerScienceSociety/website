Redesign the Carleton Central ["menu"](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/hack-the-tunnels-starter-2024/blob/main/client/src/pages/Menu/Menu.tsx) page to be responsive and mobile-friendly. The current menu is built for desktop screens, and your task is to make it adjust and display properly on mobile devices with various screen sizes.

Use techniques such as CSS [Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp), [Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp), and [media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) to ensure the layout adapts smoothly to smaller screens.

**Note:** Only worry about preserving links to the "BuildTimetable" and "Timetables" pages. You can remove the rest of the links on this screen (if you want).

## Acceptance Criteria:

- The redesigned Carleton Central menu must be fully responsive, working well on mobile and tablet screen sizes.
- The participant must include at least one media query to adjust layout or styling based on screen width.
- The solution should maintain the usability and functionality of the original menu while improving the mobile experience.
