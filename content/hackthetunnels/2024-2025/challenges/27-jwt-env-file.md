Currently in the codebase, the JWT secret is being hard coded... this is not good (see: `service/src/config/jwt.ts`).

We should instead use a [`.env`](https://medium.com/@sujathamudadla1213/what-is-the-use-of-env-8d6b3eb94843) file to store sensitive information.

## Acceptance Criteria:

The participant instead reads the JWT secret off of the `.env` file.
