Add a **"max registration"** column to the `scheduledEvents` table in the relational database. This column should store the maximum number of students allowed to register for each scheduled event.

Ensure that the migration is created and executed correctly, and update any relevant models or services to reflect this new column.

For help creating a Prisma migration, see [this guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/getting-started).
