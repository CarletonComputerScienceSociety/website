On the BuildTimetable page, add UI that allows the user to search for courses by program (ex: COMP, MATH, etc)

To query the backend, you can either add new program [query parameter](https://www.branch.io/glossary/query-parameters/#:~:text=Query%20parameters%20are%20a%20defined,web%20server%20when%20making%20requests.) to the `/scheduledEvents` endpoint or create a new endpoint.

## Acceptance Criteria:

The participant can demostrate the different results are returned for each selected program.
