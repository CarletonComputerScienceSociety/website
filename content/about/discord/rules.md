# Discord Code of Conduct

Our server follows the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). No illegal content is allowed. In addition, our rules are an extension of the [CCSS Code of Conduct](http://ccss.carleton.ca/about/governance/).

## 🧠 Avoid Sensitive Topics
Discussions involving sensitive or polarizing topics (such as political or religious views) can quickly derail conversations, make others uncomfortable, and undermine the supportive environment we're trying to maintain. To keep the focus on learning and collaboration, please avoid these subjects entirely. Moderators may step in at any time to end or redirect such discussions. This server is meant to be a helpful resource for students—not a public forum for open debate.

## 📰 Respect Academic Integrity
Do not share code, questions, answers, or solutions related to course evaluations or assignments. This is considered academic dishonesty and violators will be reported to Carleton University for plagiarism.

## 💬 Be Respectful
Harassment, discrimination, or hateful conduct of any kind (including sexism, racism, homophobia, ableism, and similar behavior) will not be tolerated. This includes language, imagery, or messages sent in public or private chats. Disrespect toward university staff, teaching assistants, or professors—whether direct or indirect—is not allowed. Criticism is fine, but personal attacks, mocking, or hostile behavior toward individuals or the institution undermines the purpose of this server as a constructive academic space. If you wouldn’t say it to someone in person, don’t say it here.

## 🧪 Don’t Give Bad-Faith Advice
Advice shared here should be honest, well-intentioned, and based on your best understanding. Deliberately misleading, sarcastic, or dismissive answers—especially when someone is asking for help—are not acceptable. If you see a question that seems obvious or like common sense, be patient. Many members are new and still learning. Treat all questions with respect, and focus on being helpful—not judgmental.

## 🚫 Keep It Appropriate
Usernames, nicknames, avatars, bios, and messages must remain appropriate. No NSFW content, offensive material, disturbing imagery, or intentionally disruptive formatting (e.g. zalgo, blank names, slurs). Anything intended to shock, provoke, or offend is grounds for removal.

## 📢 No Spam or Self-Promotion
Do not spam messages, ping repeatedly, or promote your own servers, socials, or content without permission. Promote opportunities you think would interest CS students in the bulletin-board channel, and feel free to ping the "Bulletin Board" role. If you're unsure whether something belongs in the channel or server, ask a moderator before posting.

## 📔 Use Common Sense
This list isn’t exhaustive. Moderators may take action on any behavior that harms the community, even if not explicitly mentioned here. Treat others kindly, and use your best judgment when interacting on the server. 
Respect the moderators. They’re here to keep things welcoming and civil. You must comply with their requests in a timely fashion. If you have concerns about a moderator, please contact the CCSS President.

If you see any examples you feel contradict these rules, please ping the "Moderator" role

# Strikes and Examples of Their Consequences

**Strike 1:** Warning, messages deleted, and/or mic mute.

**Strike 2:** Warning, 24h server mute (text & mic), and/or kicked from event.

**Strike 3:** Indefinite server mute (text & mic), ban without warning.

- A moderator reserves the right to apply more severe consequences regardless of the number of offences.

- A moderator reserves the right to delete any kind of message at any time. In addition, a bot is also handling automatic message deletion. Contact a moderator if you think your message was wrongfully removed for this reason.

- If you do not respond to a moderator's requests in a timely manner (i.e. 24 hours), this will likely result in an automatic ban regardless of the rule. If you missed their message, you can reach out through DMs to reverse the decision.

- Disrespecting a moderator reaching out to you may result in an additional strike, or even a ban.

- You can direct message the CCSS President to appeal a ban/mute/strike.
