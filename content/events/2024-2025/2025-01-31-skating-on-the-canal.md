This event is subject to the Rideau Canal Skateway being open with good ice conditions on the day of the event. Please keep an eye on our socials for any updates regarding the event.

We will be meeting at the [Lansdowne - Fifth Avenue (Fifth Rest Area)](https://goo.gl/maps/Ps5rWPKWX8hwWuJfA) access point for the start of the event. You are welcome to use a separate access point (for example, the one next to campus) and skate over, or commute to that access point.</br>
Here is the [list of access points](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/access-points-rideau-canal-skateway) as well as an [interactive map](https://ncc-ccn.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=795623808c5c49388aa7dc5f94890a40).


If you need rental skates, you can reserve them online [here](https://rideaucanalskateway.com/fr/collections/all). Rental skates cost **$33 for 2 hours** and there is also a **$50 security deposit.** Please select the Fifth Avenue - Lansdowne pickup point for rentals.
