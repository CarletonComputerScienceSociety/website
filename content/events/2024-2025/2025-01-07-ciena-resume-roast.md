We are collaborating with Rachael King from Ciena for a resume roast!

If you are interested, submit your resume anonymously via this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYcOaz4pTMNnupU46ps0U_zvabVk5e_rtoTFu3aOjiBvbtuQ/viewform) by **December 30th**

Please note:
- You must remove any personal information such as your name, email etc before submitting your resume
- This is **not** a 1 on 1 review. Selected resumes will be projected on a whiteboard as examples to provide advice
- Submitting your resume does not guarantee that it will be reviewed at the event
- There will be a Q&A period where you can ask questions

Submitting your resume is **not required** to attend this event.
