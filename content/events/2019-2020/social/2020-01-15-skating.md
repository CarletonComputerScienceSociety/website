## Description

Want to go skating with a group? Next Wednesday, the CCSS invites you to join us at the Carleton Ice House for a campus skating session. You can either meetup at the CCSS lounge, then walk with us to the ice house, or meet us there!

Part of a series of events targeted at first-year students.
