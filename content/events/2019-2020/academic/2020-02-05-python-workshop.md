## Description

Learn how to brainstorm, plan, and develop fun and interesting personal projects with just the content taught in COMP1405.

In this workshop we'll bring project ideas, talk about how we came up with them, then help everyone brainstorm their own ideas. Finally, we'll go through what's involved in starting one of these projects and develop one ourselves
