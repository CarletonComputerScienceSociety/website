## Description

The CCSS is holding its Fall General Meeting in HP 5345 next Thursday, October 10 at 6pm. Topics to be covered include: a presentation of our budget, a discussion of our current plans for the rest of the academic year, and a general question-and-answer period.

We encourage all CCSS members to attend so that you are well-informed about what the society is working on this year. Also, there will be food for everyone at the conclusion of the meeting!
