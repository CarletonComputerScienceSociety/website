## Description

Come on down and cheer for your favourite Csgo Team! With the Eleague Major 2017 right around the corner, thereâ€™s no better way to enjoy the finals than at Carleton with all of your friends. We will be providing snacks and drinks for everyone during the stream.

Unfortunately the tournament Grand Final ended up on a Sunday but we can promise you it'll be worth getting up for 10:00AM! We hope to see a lot of people there.
