## Description

Once again the CCSS is hosting Prof Night at Mike's Place on Thursday November 10th. For those of you who donâ€™t know, Prof Night is an opportunity for students and professors to hang out and talk over a couple drinks and snacks. All computer science students and profs will even get their first drink on us!
