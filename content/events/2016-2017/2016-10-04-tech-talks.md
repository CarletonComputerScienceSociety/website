## Description

Come check out some amazing tech talks by Julia Duimovich and Andrew Low on Tuesday, October 2:

-----

Python is everywhere- whether it's Django web apps, scripts as the glue holding your systems together, data science, or anything else you want. Since you already know how to code, referencing the docs to learn the basic syntax is a quick way to start coding in Python. But how do you learn the Pythonic way? The ecosystem? Patterns and anti-patterns? 1) join the Python community. 2) Come and see this talk!

Julia has been a Python fan since she started programming in high school. Since then, she has graduated from a CS degree at Queen's University. She fell accidentally into the role of conference organizer and now helps organize 2 different PyCons behind the scenes (and used Python to do it, obviously). She thinks yak shaving is the bane of every developer's existence but the best phrase. You can find her on Twitter as @jduims.

Learn about working with open source, debugging skills and using tools effectively. Here are some things that every good programmer should know.

Andrew's areas of specialty include Java Virtual Machine Implementer / Expert, low level debugging, and strong mentorship. He lead the team porting Node.js and the V8 Javascript Engine to IBM systems (PPC, s390). Currently working as part of the IBM Cloud division.

He's performed a range of roles over his 20 years of experience. Most have been dirctly related to hands on delivery of solutions to customers, he's also spent time working with a corporate technical strategy team working with IBMers across the many IBM divisions.

Andrew joined IBM via the acquisition of Object Technology International in 1996 and is now a Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM). With a reputation for delivering solutions, he has worked on runtimes for the very small: Nokia cell phones / Palm PDA devices, to the very large: IBM zSeries (System/390) mainframe systems.
