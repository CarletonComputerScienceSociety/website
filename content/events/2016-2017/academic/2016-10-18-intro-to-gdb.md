## Description


Why am I segfaulting? - An introduction to GDB. David Manouchehri is going to be talking about how to effectively use GDB to debug code. This is a skill everybody should probably have by the end of their university career!

This is an interactive workshop, so you should bring a laptop or be prepared to use one of the lab computers.
