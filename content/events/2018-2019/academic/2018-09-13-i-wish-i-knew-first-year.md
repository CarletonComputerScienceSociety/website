## Description

Hello first years! Come learn from some of the mistakes and pitfalls that upper year students made when they were in their first year.

We'll be covering a wide range of subjects that'll be super useful to 1st years, including:
- Side projects
- Networking with upper years students
- Hofstadter's Law
- Applying for internships in 1st year
- much more!

We'll have a panel of speakers in 2nd year and above to talk about the subjects above (along with any other subjects) and answer any questions!
