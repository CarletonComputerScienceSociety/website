## Description

Come out to the Carleton .devClub() to work on side projects, school work, or learn something new! There will be mentors there to help where they can.

This week's workshop will be the Advent of Code. The Advent of Code is a programming contest that releases a new challenge every day from Dec 1st to Dec 25th. In this workshop, we will be working through the challenges from the first to the fourth.
