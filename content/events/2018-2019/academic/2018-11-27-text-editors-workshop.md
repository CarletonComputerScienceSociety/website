## Description

Come out to the Carleton .devClub() to work on side projects, school work, or learn something new! There will be mentors there to help where they can.

This week's workshop, Text Editors, will take a look at the different ways to write code. Nano, Notepad++, Sublime, or Eclipse all have their pros and cons, so let's take a look at them.
