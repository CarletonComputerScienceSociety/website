## Description

Hello second years! Come learn from some of the mistakes and pitfalls that upper year students made when they were in their second year.

We'll be covering a wide range of subjects that'll be super useful to 2nd years, including:
- Side projects
- Writing CS focused resumes
- Preparing for technical interviews (and useful resources)
- Events and conferences to attend
- much more!

We'll have a panel of speakers in 3rd year and above to talk about the subjects above (along with any other subjects) and answer any questions!
