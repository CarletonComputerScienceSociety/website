## Description

The CCSS and WiCS are partnering up to organize a lunch potluck event, open to students, faculty and staff. Join us on March 19, from noon to 2 pm, for a casual social gathering with great food!

All attendees must bring something to share (non-junk food preferred). There will be access to a microwave oven, in case you need to heat your dish.

See you there!
