## Description

We're partnering up with the Carleton Science Student Society (CSSS) to end our Week of Awesome with an outdoor barbecue at Mooney's Bay! Come out and enjoy good food with great company under the sun. All science students welcome! Note: parking at Mooney's Bay is $1.50/hour.

We will be selling:
Burger - $3
Hot Dog - $2
Soft Drink - $1

Also, if you get a meal deal of all 3 of the above, it will only cost $5!
