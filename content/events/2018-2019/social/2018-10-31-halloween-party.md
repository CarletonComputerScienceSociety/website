## Description

It's time to get spoopy!

Join your CS friends this Halloween for an evening of amusement. We will be celebrating the frightful night in 5345 Herzberg, come if you DARE...

Make sure to come dressed in costume, so that you'll be entered in our costume contest for a chance to win a Starbucks gift card!

Then, get ready for as many laughs as scares when we watch What We Do in the Shadows, starting at 8pm! (More info on the movie here: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3416742/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3416742/))
