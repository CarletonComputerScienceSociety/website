## Description


Week of Awesome is bringing you to Mike's Place! Spend the evening participating in trivia, enjoying open mic performances, and hanging out with friends new and old. All ages welcome!

Trivia (using the Kahoot app) will commence at 6pm. Then, at 7pm, we will have our open mic until the end of the night. If you have ever wanted to perform something in front of a supportive audience, now is your chance! Email william.so@ccss.carleton.ca to reserve a 5-minute timeslot in the lineup, or sign up for a free slot when you arrive.

We will be renting a digital piano and an acoustic-electric guitar, as well as several microphones, available to use for open mic performances. (You may also bring your own instruments to perform with.) We would appreciate if attendees could make a small donation (~$2) to help cover the cost of these rentals.
