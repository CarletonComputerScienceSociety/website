## Description

At our Winter General Meeting, we'll be going over what the CCSS Board of Directors has done thus far, as well as elections for next year's board. Anyone interested in the position of Electoral Officer, please contact Tyler (tyler.fleming@ccss.carleton.ca).
And as always, pizza will be provided.
