## Description


So now you've got a good idea of what to put on your resume, but how do you actually handle the first social interview?

Well don't worry, because this Friday we're going to have two Carleton Comp Sci alumni, Eashan from Akamai and Lindsay from RBC, come by to give a presentation and Q&A session on how to ace the social interview.

You'll get to learn how to handle the behavioral side of interviews, and everything that isn't directly related to programming. Both of our speakers have experience in the hiring process for social interviews, so they're some of the best sources to have on the subject. If you're preparing for an upcoming interview you definitely don't want to miss out!
