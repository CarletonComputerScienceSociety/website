## Description

Want to make $5k in one day, legally?

Code/Design to Win is exactly what it sounds like, two completely different competitions with two ginormous grand prizes and several less substantial (but significant) cash rewards. If you’re a student who loves computer science, programming or product design and attends one of the many participating schools, this is a challenge for you. We’ll take care of all the details, just bring your skills and we'll pay the billz.
How does one apply?

First, you’ll have to write the preliminary challenge (don’t worry, you got this). Find your school in the list below to register. The top students will be invited to the Communitech Hub in Waterloo Region on January 19 & 20, 2018, to participate in the finals, meet with some really great companies, and have your shot at taking home $5,000!
