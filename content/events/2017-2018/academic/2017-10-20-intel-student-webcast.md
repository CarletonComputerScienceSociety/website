## Description

We've all recently been hearing about how AI is the bees knees. Odds are you were interested in getting into it, but weren't sure where to start? Well guess what? Intel is hosting an AI focused webcast this October 20th!

As always for our awesome academic events, there will be pizza and beverages (FREE of charge!). If we can get a turnout of 20+ we'll be able to even double our food (and possibly provide some even fancier meals).

While free food is great and all, we know you're all here for the content. The webcast will cover some really interesting topics in the area including:
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning Fundamentals
- Applications in Real Life
- Deep Learning Examples, like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image Recognition
- How Intel plans to help developers to improve performance of Machine Learning workloads
- What frameworks are optimized for Intel Architecture, and how you can get access to them

Remember to register for the event on eventbrite to get updates as we get closer to the event: [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/intel-nervanatm-ai-academy-student-webcast-tickets-37547703191?aff=IEM&fbclid=IwAR1VIpkrMJXBmiyfYb7Q3Dkq_1nWZts_d0p8R0OqPL_WIYrtgwaoMxwayi0](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/intel-nervanatm-ai-academy-student-webcast-tickets-37547703191?aff=IEM&fbclid=IwAR1VIpkrMJXBmiyfYb7Q3Dkq_1nWZts_d0p8R0OqPL_WIYrtgwaoMxwayi0)

NOTE: Please RSVP to the event so we know how many people are going. We want to make sure we get 20+ turnout!
