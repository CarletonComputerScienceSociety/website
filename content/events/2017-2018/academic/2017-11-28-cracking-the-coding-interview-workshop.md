## Description

Do you have any interviews lined up? Uncertain what sort of questions to expect?

Come by to our cracking the coding interview workshop this upcoming Tuesday. You'll get to work in a group to solve technical questions from varying ranges of difficulty. These are questions that Google, Amazon, and Facebook ask during interviews, so this could be a great way to prepare!
