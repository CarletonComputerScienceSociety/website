## Description

Preparing for co-op and internship applications this upcoming summer, but not sure where to begin? Well you're in luck because we'll be having a workshop this upcoming Tuesday where you'll get the opportunity to chat with recruiters in the industry! We'll also have a resume roast, where we'll have recruiters go over your (anonymized) resumes and cover the pros and cons of each one.

Get feedback on everything from what makes a perfectly crafted resume, to standing out during the initial application process! We'll also later be providing a form to submit resumes for the resume roast segment. Don't worry though, these resumes will be anonymized. Remember, this is an opportunity to receive feedback directly from those who would be hiring you, without any fear of rejection!

You can submit your resume for the resume workshop via the Google form below:
