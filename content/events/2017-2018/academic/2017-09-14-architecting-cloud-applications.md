How to architect cloud applications for scalability, performance, and resiliency

Description:
The talk focuses on challenges of building software in the cloud and at scale including performance, scalability, and resiliency. We'll discuss why the above non-functional are as important as functional requirements. Moreover, Klipfolio's technology stack will be introduced and used throughout the presentation as an example. Furthermore, we'll discuss some of the architectural patterns that can be used in cloud applications for scalability and resiliency purposes.
