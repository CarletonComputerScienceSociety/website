As part of an exciting week of career-related programming, Co-op and Career Services and our presenting sponsor, Ericsson, are pleased to host a networking evening celebrating Diversity in Engineering and Technology!

This event will allow co-op students and new graduates from underrepresented groups to meet and mingle with employers from engineering and IT-related firms who are dedicated to creating a diverse workforce. Meet representatives from a range of engineering and IT firms and hear about their exciting plans for the future and their commitment to inclusion and diversity.
