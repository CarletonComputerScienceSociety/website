## Description

Registration is open on mySuccess!

As part of an exciting week of career-related programming, Co-op and Career Services and our presenting sponsor, Ericsson, are pleased to host a networking evening celebrating Diversity in Engineering and Technology!

This event will allow co-op students and new graduates from underrepresented groups to meet and mingle with employers from engineering and IT-related firms who are dedicated to creating a diverse workforce. Meet representatives from a range of engineering and IT firms and hear about their exciting plans for the future and their commitment to inclusion and diversity.

Don't forget to bring your resumes and/or networking cards!

Thank you to our Supporting Sponsors, Amdocs and SNC Lavalin!

This event is particularly relevant for students and new graduates under-represented in engineering and technological fields; however, any co-op students or students approaching graduation are welcome to attend.

Reminder: The following day (Jan. 24) is Co-op and Career Services' Summer Job Fair! Make sure you stop by the UC Galleria from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and check it out!
