## Description

It's that time again, Prof Night is happening, Tuesday February 27th. Prof Night is an excellent opportunity to get to know your profs in a less formal setting. What are they like as people? What are they researching? Would they be a good honours supervisor for you? Excellent questions to explore!

First drink is free for Computer Science students and faculty but to help manage numbers we ask you to come pick up your drink ticket in advance at the Computer Science Society office, HP 4135, starting Tuesday, Feb 13th.
