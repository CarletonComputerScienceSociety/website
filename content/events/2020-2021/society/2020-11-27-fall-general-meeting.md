All CCSS members (that's you!) are encouraged to attend the general meeting to be well-informed about the activities of the society. To sweeten the deal, all attendees will be entered into a raffle for a chance to win one of five tickets to CUSEC 2021!

The meeting will take place virtually on Microsoft Teams.
