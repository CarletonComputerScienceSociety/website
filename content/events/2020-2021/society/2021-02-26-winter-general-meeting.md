## Description

The CCSS Winter General Meeting will be taking place this Friday, February 26 at 6:00 PM EST.

At the meeting, we will discuss the goals of the society, report on this year's accomplishments, kick off the CCSS 2021 General Election period, and allow members to ask society-related questions directly to the Board of Directors. All CCSS members (that's you!) are encouraged to attend the general meeting to be well-informed about the activities of the society.
