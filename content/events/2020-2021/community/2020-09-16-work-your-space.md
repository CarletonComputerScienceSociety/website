## Description

For school this year, we will all be spending hours on end sitting in our rooms in front of our computers - whether it be for virtual lectures, coursework, or studying. So why not make that experience the best it could possibly be? The CCSS wants you to succeed in your studies, and that means making sure your workspace works for you! At this Week of Awesome Talk, we will cover the basics of desktop organization, ergonomics, and good work habits to keep you physically and mentally healthy.

This event will be hosted on Thursday, September 16 at 4:00 PM EDT, here on the CCSS Discord server.
