## Description

Are you an incoming or returning CS student looking to get involved this year, but not sure how?

Well, look no further! To kick off (and close off) this year’s CCSS Week of Awesome, we are collaborating with ALL clubs and societies affiliated with the School of Computer Science (SCS) to bring you an exciting, virtual CS Clubs & Societies Information Session! 

- This info session will be happening on Sunday, September 13 @ 1:00 pm EDT and Saturday, September 19 @ 9:00 am EDT.

- Every club and society will speak for approximately 5 minutes each, and there will be a 30 minutes Q&A session at the end.

- An email will be going out to all CS students soon with a Microsoft Teams link to the event. So be sure to check your Carleton email account within the next 2 weeks!

We hope to see you all there!
