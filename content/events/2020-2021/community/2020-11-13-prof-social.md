## Description

One of the most popular recurring CCSS events is Prof Night - where we have historically invited SCS faculty to socialize with students at Mike's Place Pub on campus.

Since we can't meet in-person, this year's version of Prof Night will be taking place on Zoom!

Students and faculty members will have a chance to mingle with one another in a number of breakout rooms. We have also invited the Fall Carleton CS graduating cohort to join us and commemorate their success!

This event will take place on Friday, November 13 at 12:00 PM EST, through Zoom.
