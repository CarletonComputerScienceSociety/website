## Description

Are you an international student coming to Carleton for the first time this year? Whether you're here for a short time on exchange or starting the multi-year journey of completing a degree, the CCSS wants you to feel welcomed in our community!

Please join us on Monday, September 7 from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM EDT to attend a panel of fellow international students ranging from 2nd to 4th year, who chose to study computer science at Carleton, just like you! They will be talking about their experiences as international students in CS and answering any questions or concerns that you may have :yellow_heart:! We will also have a representative from the International Student Services Office (ISSO) who will be doing a short presentation on all the resources Carleton has to offer you :clap:!
