## Description

Do you want to learn more about equity, inclusion and how student communities can strive to empower everybody? Come learn with the CCSS on Thursday, November 12 from 12 – 1 PM EST! We’re attending an Equity and Inclusion Workshop hosted by the Carleton Department of Equity and Inclusive Communities over Zoom. We’re going to be looking at scenarios where we can apply our knowledge, engage with concepts and advance our awareness of what it means to be equitable and inclusive. Hope to see you there! ⭐️
