## Description

Are you prepared for midterm season? Don't panic! The CCSS will be facilitating a session of extra studying to help students review material from the Discrete Structures courses you know and love. We will identify some core concepts, solve a series of preselected practice problems step-by-step, and then we will open the event up to a freeform group work period, providing additional guidance at the students' request.

We will have a session for COMP 1805 on Sunday, October 11th at 4:00 pm EDT, and one for COMP 2804 on Sunday, October 18th at 4:00 pm EDT. These sessions will take place here on the CCSS Discord server.
