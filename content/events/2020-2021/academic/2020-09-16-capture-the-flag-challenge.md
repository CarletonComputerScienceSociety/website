## Description

As a bonus, there will be a Capture The Flag competition happening after [Forest's Week of Awesome Tech Talk on the information security industry](https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/academic/2020-09-16-intro-to-hacking/). This will be an opportunity to learn some of the concepts discussed in the presentation. It's designed for people of all skill levels, so don't be afraid to give it a go! The Carleton Cyber Security Club will be helping to host the CTF, and we will use their Discord for communication during the CTF. So be sure to head there after the presentation!
