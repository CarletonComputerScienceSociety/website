## Description

We have invited Jeremy Clark, an associate professor at the Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, back for an interactive Q&A session to continue the discussion on crypto and blockchain technology!

Given that there were many audience questions left unanswered during his previous lecture, and many of you expressed interest in having Jeremy back, we are very happy to be hosting this follow-up discussion session.
