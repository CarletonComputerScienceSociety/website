## Description

SCESoc and the CCSS are collaborating this semester to bring you an epic Project Showcase Night!

Got any side projects or class projects you're super stoked about sharing? Maybe you've been developing a game or a website that you really want to show off.

Join us all on March 5th to present your projects (finished or not!) to your peers! Sign up here if you want to showcase your project: [https://forms.gle/SzUqcsnV5az4d6Rv6](https://forms.gle/SzUqcsnV5az4d6Rv6). Attendees (that will just be spectating!) don't need to sign up! See you there!
