## Description

This December, celebrate the holidays with [Advent of Code!](https://adventofcode.com/)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This year, the CCSS will be hosting its own Advent of Code leaderboard and solutions repository! To join other participating Carleton CS students, login to Advent of Code and join using our unique leaderboard code: **970906-fa1dc2ae**

Interested in sharing your solution? We will also be hosting our own [solutions repository](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/advent-of-code-2020) on Github for any Carleton students to contribute to.
