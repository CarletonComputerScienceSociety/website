## Description

In the spirit of staying connected with one another in a remote learning environment, the CCSS cordially invites you to a virtual Prof Social, to be hosted on Zoom!

During the event, students and faculty members will have a chance to mingle with one another in a number of breakout rooms. At regular intervals, participants will be prompted to switch rooms and continue the conversation with new faces! This event was inspired by the Prof Nights from previous years, and serves as a COVID-safe substitute.
