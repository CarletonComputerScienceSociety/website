## Description

For this year's Week of Awesome Tech Talk, we've enlisted the help Forest, a beloved CCSS veteran, to give a talk on the information security industry. He'll be exploring the mindset behind solving problems in different domains such as cryptography, steganography, and web, leaving you with some resources at the end on how to learn more for yourself! 

This talk will be hosted on Wednesday, September 16 at 2:00 PM EDT, here on the CCSS Discord server.

As a bonus, there will be a [Capture The Flag competition](https://ccss.carleton.ca/ccss-website/events/2020-2021/academic/2020-09-16-capture-the-flag-challenge/) happening after the talk. This will be an opportunity to learn some of the concepts discussed in the presentation. It's designed for people of all skill levels, so don't be afraid to give it a go! The Carleton Cyber Security Club will be helping to host the CTF, and we will use their Discord for communication during the CTF. So be sure to head there after the presentation!
