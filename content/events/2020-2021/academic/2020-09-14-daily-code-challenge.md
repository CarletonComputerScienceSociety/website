## Description

If summer has turned your brain to mush, or you're just looking for a fun challenge to keep your skills sharp, then look no further! Every weekday of Week of Awesome, the CCSS will be releasing a series of programming puzzles to get you back into your coding groove! Three questions will be released at midnight (12 AM EDT) everyday from September 14 to September 18, which you will have 24 hours to solve and submit. Each correct submission gives you an entry into a prize raffle - the more you participate, the higher your chances of winning are! At the end of the week, 3 winners will be drawn to receive a $25 gift card of their choice. Stay tuned for details on how to submit your answers - more info coming soon!
