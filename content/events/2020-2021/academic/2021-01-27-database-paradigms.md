## Description

We're back with more more bi-weekly Tech Talks on Wednesdays during Dev Club! This week we're talking database paradigms-- Matthew, Director of Finance/Academics, will be going over several new and old types of database engines including Relational, NoSQL, Graph databases, and more!

The presentation will cover the pros, cons, and use cases for each variety of database and will expand off the material covered in COMP 3005 and COMP 2406. But don't worry if you haven't taken those courses yet-- we're going to keep it simple so it'll still be accessible if you have no prior experience with databases!

Hope you'll join us on Discord this Wednesday @ 6pm EST!
