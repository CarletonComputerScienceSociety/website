## Description

Grab some popcorn and get comfy for the CCSS's Week of Awesome: Movie Night! We will be watching a CS-themed movie together on Monday, September 14 at 7:00 PM EDT, using Netflix. You will need a Netflix subscription in order to watch along with us (if you don't have one, you can get a 30-day trial for free). Download the Netflix Party Chrome browser extension, and keep your eyes on our social media so you can join the party when it starts! We will also open a voice channel on our Discord server for this event.
