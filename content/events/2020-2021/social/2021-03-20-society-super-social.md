## Description

Looking to meet and mingle with other students from Computer Science and Engineering? The CCSS, WiCS, SCESoc, and WISE are organizing a fun get-together on gather.town on Saturday, March 20 from 5-7 pm EDT!

During the first hour, we will have an ice breaker game, geoguessr, and skribbl, with prizes up for grabs! During the second hour, there will be time to chat with each other and optionally play some mini games!

Don’t want to play any games and just want to chill? We've got you - there will also be a space to simply chat with one another! Register at [https://forms.gle/EU5K6kwyaxoMAao86](https://forms.gle/EU5K6kwyaxoMAao86), and we’ll send the gather.town link closer to the date. See you there!
