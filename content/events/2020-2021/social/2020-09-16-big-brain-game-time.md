## Description

It's trivia night, so put your thinking caps on! To keep our Week of Awesome going, the CCSS is putting together three rounds of Carleton/CS trivia using everyone's favourite quizzing platform: Kahoot! For each round, the person who scores the most points will win a $10 gift card. Best of luck!

After putting your knowledge to the test, unwind with some casual Jackbox party games! You'll laugh out loud watching your CS friends fumble over silly wordsmithing, trivia, and doodling games. All you need to play Kahoot and Jackbox are a smartphone and an internet connection - no need to download anything!

This event will be hosted on Wednesday, September 16 at 7:30 PM EDT, here on the CCSS Discord server.
