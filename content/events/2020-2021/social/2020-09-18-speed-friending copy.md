## Description

The friendships and connections you make with your fellow students are essential to the university experience. Studying remotely can make it more difficult for students to connect, but the CCSS is here to help remedy that! Closing off Week of Awesome 2020, we're bringing you a speed friending event that will give you all a chance to meet new friends in Carleton CS and build quick bonds with them. Join this event on our Discord server and you'll be randomly shuffled into a new group conversation every few minutes. You'll be amazed at how quickly you can find common interests with one another!

This event will be hosted on Friday, September 18 at 1:00 PM EDT, here on the CCSS Discord server.
