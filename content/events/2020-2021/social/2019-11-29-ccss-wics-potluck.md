## Description

CCSS and WiCS are partnering up to organize a lunch potluck event, open to students, faculty and staff! Join us for a casual social gathering with great food!

Feel free to bring something so that there’s enough for everyone to share (non-junk food preferred)! There will be access to a microwave oven in case you need to heat your dish.

Please let us know what you’re bringing in this spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O20M_izR-X7w6DKGVZXuWslYZzcFm5QMdQZQme_OKv4/edit?fbclid=IwAR1lTlcrTB2zZQilEKfjnXb4PfWH9efQogmi5FbCWAXXidT9lOaYViEcFRY#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O20M_izR-X7w6DKGVZXuWslYZzcFm5QMdQZQme_OKv4/edit?fbclid=IwAR1lTlcrTB2zZQilEKfjnXb4PfWH9efQogmi5FbCWAXXidT9lOaYViEcFRY#gid=0)
