## Description

Get your headsets ready, because the CCSS is gaming online together for Week of Awesome 2020! Join your CS peers on our Discord server to play Minecraft, League of Legends, Rocket League, Fortnite, or whatever you like! This is a great opportunity to find people who play the same games as you, or to be introduced to a new that you might enjoy! We'll be splitting everyone up into groups based on the games you want to play, so that you can all stream, chat and play together. 

This event will be hosted on Tuesday, September 15 at 7:30 PM EDT, here on the CCSS Discord server.
