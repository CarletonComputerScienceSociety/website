### Project Board

All issues can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/projects/17). These issues can be done individually or collaboratively at any time!

### In-Person Sessions

In-person sessions will be centered around collaboration and guiding students through their first contributions towards new and existing CCSS projects.

### Getting Asynchronous Help

If you cannot make it to our in-person sessions but still need help, you can send a message in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/TVHaxACPqk)!
