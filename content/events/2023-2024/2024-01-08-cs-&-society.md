The tech industry, accustomed to disrupting traditional businesses, is undergoing unforeseen shifts in 2022-2023, with slowed growth and a newfound emphasis on profitability. Despite numerous open IT positions, concerns loom over the impact on tech careers. The introduction of Generative AI, including tools like Copilot and DALLE2, has amplified the potential for substantial work automation, reshaping the industry's landscape. Industry veteran Dave Thomas, drawing from five decades of experience, explores the implications of these disruptive changes in his talk. He shares insights on learning from past transformations, highlights key areas for individual and team investment, and provides a forward-looking perspective on the evolving dynamics of Tech and Tech Careers in the 202x.
