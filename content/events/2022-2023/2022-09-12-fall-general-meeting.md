## Description

**Zoom Link:** [https://carleton-ca.zoom.us/j/92598592554](https://carleton-ca.zoom.us/j/92598592554)

Be sure to join us for our Fall General Meeting on **September 12th @ 5PM EST!**

Wondering what events or services we'll be organizing this semester? Interested in getting involved with the CCSS as a volunteer? Attending the Fall General Meeting is a great way to learn all about the CCSS and how you can get involved!

We will be hosting our Fall General Meeting as a **hybrid event**. This means you will be able to attend the event in person in **HP 5345** or virtually via **Zoom**.
