## Description

This December, celebrate the holidays with [Advent of Code!](https://adventofcode.com/)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language you like.

Interested in sharing your solution? We will also be hosting our own [solutions repository](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/advent-of-code) on Github for any Carleton students to contribute to.
