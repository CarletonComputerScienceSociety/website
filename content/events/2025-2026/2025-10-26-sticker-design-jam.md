## Design Categories
- **Carleton Spirit:** Any design that relates to Carleton University in some way!
- **Creature Feature:** Your design can involve any sort of animal (ex: capybaras, crabs, groundhogs, etc.)
- **Hack the Sticker:** Any Computer Science / Tech themed stickers can go here!
- **Outside the Box:** Have a design that doesn't quite fit any of the above categories? This is the category for them!

<br/>

Submit your best sticker designs for a chance to have them printed! Students will vote on their favourite designs, and the **top picks will be printed and sold as CCSS Merch** (with the winning designer receiving their sticker for free!) 

üïê This form will close at **midnight (11:59 PM) on October 26th** (Sunday).

Designs should be in a **square or circle shape** as those are those shapes we are able to print for this event. Die-cut sticker designs can't be printed. 

You're welcome to **submit multiple designs!**

**Please read the following rule before submitting a design:**

**üö´ Keep It Appropriate:** Designs should avoid sensitive or polarizing topics (e.g., politics, religion) and must not include NSFW, offensive, or disturbing content. 
Reviewers may remove any designs deemed inappropriate or not in the spirit of the event.
