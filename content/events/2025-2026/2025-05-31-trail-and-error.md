**Notice: A MODERATE\* Air Pollution Level is predicted for 2025-06-07.**

***Moderate: "Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution."**

Please consider not attending this hike if you are someone who could potentially be affected by these conditions.

**Please arrive at Pindigen Park by 1 PM to catch the shuttle!**

To get to Pindigen Park, you can take the 10 Main line bus from Carleton to Bronson / Laurier W, after which Pindigen is a 10 minute walk away. 
[Google maps path](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aZiGCe9jF6oaXfU47).

Make sure you **bring sunscreen**, at least 2 refillable bottles full of **water** and wear **proper hiking clothes and shoes**, as this is listed as a 'challenging' trail.

We will likely be stopping at some point through the hike to have lunch, so **bringing light food / snacks is recommended.**
