### üêç What is Battlesnake? 
Battlesnake is a **twist on the classic Snake game** - instead of playing directly, you **write code to control your snake** as it competes against others on the board. It‚Äôs a fun way to practice developing algorithms and sharpen your problem-solving skills. 

This event is designed to be **beginner-friendly**, while still offering a fun challenge for those with more experience. 

**Even if you have little to no programming experience, we encourage you to join in!**
