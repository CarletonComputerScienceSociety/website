This event is running every other weekend for the summer, starting on June 29th (weather permitting)
### Destination
**Pink Lake Trail** at **Gatineau Park** via the **Gatineau Shuttle Bus** going from **Pindigen Park** to **Pink Lake**.
### Transportation
To get to Pindigen Park, you can take the 10 Main line bus from Carleton to Bronson / Laurier W, after which Pindigen is a 10 minute walk away. 
[Google maps path](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aZiGCe9jF6oaXfU47).

Make sure you **bring sunscreen**, at least 2 refillable bottles full of **water** and wear **proper hiking clothes and shoes**, as this is listed as a 'challenging' trail.

We will likely be stopping at some point through the hike to have lunch, so **bringing light food / snacks is recommended.**

A map of the park can be found [here](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/gatineau-park-trails-map).

**NOTE:** *Hikes may be postponed depending on the weather. If the date changes, weâ€™ll post updates on our Instagram stories and Discord.*
