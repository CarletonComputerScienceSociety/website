## Description

Ever wondered how you can get involved in the amazing community of the CCSS? Look no further! The CCSS Expo will introduce you to everything that the CCSS has to offer and how to get involved in the community at a deeper level! 

Our very own Director of Community will introduce Fall semester plans from every CCSS Director, hint at what to expect from later Week of Awesome events, explain how to become a volunteer and/or first-year representative, and so much more!

You'll also get the opportunity to engage in a Q&A session with her, where you can ask about her past as a First Year Representative, how the CCSS is planning for in-person return, and even how many tabs she has open on Google Chrome. :blobaww:
