## Description

To kick off (and close off) the CCSS's Week of Awesome, we are collaborating with clubs and societies affiliated with the School of Computer Science (SCS) to bring you an exciting, virtual CS Clubs & Societies Information Session!

This info session will have two identical sessions on Sunday, September 12 @ 1:00 pm EDT and Saturday, September 18 @ 9:00 am EDT.

Every club and society will speak for approximately 5 minutes each, and there will be a 30 minutes Q&A session at the end.

An email will be going out to all CS students soon with the link to the event. So be sure to check your Carleton email account within the next 2 weeks!
