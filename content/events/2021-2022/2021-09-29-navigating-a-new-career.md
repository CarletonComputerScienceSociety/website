# Navigating a New Career

Join two new Carleton grads Aarthi Ganesh and Abhi Santhosh as they unpack their ‘lessons learned’ navigating a new career as software developers at Martello Technologies. Find out what surprised them when they started and how their time at Carleton prepped them for what was next. Spoiler alert, their top tip is: “You don’t even know what you don’t know.”
