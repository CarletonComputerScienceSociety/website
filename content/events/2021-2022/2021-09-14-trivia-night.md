## Description

How many claps does the Friends intro have? When was Java invented? Who invented the shopping cart? What did Amazon first start off as? Itâ€™s time to put your random trivia knowledge to the test.

Join us on September 14th at 4PM EDT right here on our Discord server to see how much you know about random facts of the world.
