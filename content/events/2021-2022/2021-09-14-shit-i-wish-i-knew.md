## Description

Don't know what to expect out of your first year of Carleton Computer Science?

Don't panic, because the CCSS Week of Awesome has got you covered with our annual instalment of Sh*t I Wish I Knew!

Sh*t I Wish I Knew is an info session where you'll have the chance to listen to upper-year students discuss everything they wish someone had told them when they were in your shoes!

The presentation will give you tips and tricks for everything from choosing your courses to building good study habits, managing your time,  making the most of your first year,  and how to succeed as a remote student.

Join us September 14th @ 11:30 AM EDT via Zoom for another fun-filled Week of Awesome event!
