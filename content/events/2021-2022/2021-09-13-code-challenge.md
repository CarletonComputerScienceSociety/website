## Description

Welcome to the **2021-2022** **Week of Awesome** code challenge!

This week, we're going to be releasing a series of questions, all of which you can answer on the [official ccss code challenge website](https://code.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca/) for a chance to win a prize!

For every question you answer correctly, you'll earn one more entry into a randomized raffle. The more you answer, the more entries you'll get!
