## Description

The first CCSS event of the Week of Awesome is a super cool speed friending event! Come meet some new and familiar faces and make some friends!

You'll get randomly placed in groups with other amazing society members to get the chance to talk about anything and everything: whether that's your opinion on if pineapple belongs on pizza, your favourite cereal, or even your favourite sorting algorithm!

Join us here (on Discord) on September 13 and September 17, and who knows, maybe you'll have a deep philosophical conversation about cheese.
