As we’re nearing the end of the Winter term, how was this term compared to the Fall term? Was it better, worse, or the same? What did you find challenging?

The **Carleton Computer Science Society (CCSS)** wants to hear from you! It is important to us that students have their voices heard through channels that they can trust and are comfortable with. As the elected student representatives this school year, we have many opportunities to share student experiences and opinions with the School of Computer Science (SCS) and its faculty members, including teaching staff.

If you have any feedback or suggestions that you would like to share with the SCS regarding your courses this term or your online learning experience in general, please fill out the survey below by Saturday, May 1, 2021 and let us know your thoughts! We will be compiling the data and sharing it with the Director of the SCS with the goal of better supporting CS students by investigating ways the SCS could improve on for future terms and seeing what worked for students during the Fall 2020 & Winter 2021 terms.

Please note that all questions are optional, and you are free to share or omit as much as you’d like. All answers will remain anonymous. We are continuously collecting and compiling data to share with the SCS, so you can still submit responses after May 1.
