<p>Hey y'all, my name is Abdelrahim (call me abdel) and I'm a first computer science student in the software engineering stream! This is a really weird year for us all so I'd like to make it a bit easier and more fun for us. As first year rep I want to make sure that you get ample opportunities to meet new people and make the best of your first year! I also want to make sure that your voice is heard and input is passed on to the CCSS, and I'm hoping to hold more events for us to help figure out what we want to do in the future (I know it can be confusing and scary, so I'd love to reduce that stress!). If that sounds like something you're interested in, vote Abdelrahim Karaja (I won't let you down) I'm hoping to meet a lot of you this year, so HMU either way!</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Abhijeet and I’m an international student from India. I, like you, am a first-year computer science student. I know the first year of university is energizing yet it can be unpleasant too. If you choose to vote for me as your first-year representative, I will endeavour to make more CCSS events where you can relax, enjoy, and discuss your questions regarding anything in which you are facing problems together virtually. Virtual is especially hard as we all span the globe and many time zones and I will try my best to have events that cater to multiple time zones. I also want to hold a first-year social to meet as many of you as possible so that I can accurately represent your needs at CCSS meetings. I’ve previously assumed a leadership role in school so I know the responsibilities that such a position demand. Thank you for your consideration, I hope you will choose me as your first-year representative!</p>

<p>Hello world! Wait no, Hello everyone! My name is Amelie Haefele and I’m running to be your first year CCSS representative. Just like slack overflow I’ll be there for you answering all your burning questions.</p>

<p>I understand that this year’s representative is a very important position. As you all have probably realized by now COVID-19 has impacted our year greatly. Right now, most of you are probably feeling disconnected from your University experience. My goal is to change that and create a thriving community online!</p>

<p>My first goal would be to have a “Look into the Future” event where everyone would write down their goals for this year or for all of University. Then in a discord/zoom call we’d share our tips for achieving these goals, hopefully with the advice of some of Carleton's Computer Science Clubs heads/members. Then I’d compile a document with all the resources/tips discussed to help putyou on the path of success.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions, I’d be happy to answer them! I will also be holding a game night sometime this week for games like Among Us, Scribblio, and Minecraft so stay tuned for more information.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! I’m Anirudh. I’m a first-year incoming student from India. I’m
going into Bachelor of Computer Science Honors Program, Software Engineering
Stream. I am standing in these elections for the position of the First-Year
representative for the CCSS (Carleton Computer Science Society).</p>

<p>I have held various Leadership positions before. For instance, I was the House
Captain of my School (responsible for 1/4 th of all the students). Prior to that, I was
the House Prefect for several years.</p>

<p>I have great organizing skills, time-management, and am open to new ideas. But,
isn’t everyone? What I am particularly inclined towards are inter-disciplinary
projects. The way technology and Computer Science can work hand in hand with
other fields, like Medical industry, fascinates me. I am also a people’s person.
Even throughout high school, I was the guy students would contact if they wanted
to reach out to the higher authorities. So, I offer to be the representative of first
year students in CCSS and voice out their ideas and opinions.</p>

<p>I am a real fun guy to hang out with. So, if you want to know me better or have any
questions, you can ask me on the discord server or contact me on Instagram at
@anirudh_6302.</p>

<p>Hello, everyone. My name is Milo Goodfellow, and I'm a first-year computer science student at Carleton! I'd be super excited to be your first-year CCSS representative. Here are a few of the things I would look to achieve if I were elected:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Interdisciplinary connections: A lot of the work I've wanted to do in computer science would have benefitted enormously from collaboration with people interested in other fields. I would look to create spaces where CS students and people studying different domains could connect to do things they couldn't otherwise.</li>
    <li>Themed mini hackathons: Most of my favorite hackathons offer topics the day they begin. They do so to give everyone a direction to go with their work. I would look to provide these types of hackathons in shorter, more frequent times so that more people could participate without an enormous time investment.</li>
    <li>Open a suggestion box: I really want to have a large amount of open communication between the student body members and me. With that in mind, I would look to open anonline way for students to suggest new things the CCSS could do. No matter the person everyone chooses, I'm really excited to see the election's outcome and amlooking forward to my next four years at Carleton!</li>

<p>Hi I’m Preethi Nagabandi and I’m running to be your First Year Representative! I’m a first year computer science student from Ottawa and super excited to get to know you all! I’m friendly, approachable, and a good listener who is always open to new ideas. I love getting involved in the community and have many ideas to improve CCSS and make the most of our online university experience! </p>
<p>Some ideas I will implement if elected are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online game events in order for people to connect with others, relax and have fun.</li>
<li>Beginner workshops in many software development categories in order for those to get a feel for different careers in technology.</li>
<li>Study sessions for specific classes (such as COMP 1805 and others) so those who are more experienced can help others learn.</li>
<li>opportunities for those of all skill levels to improve their CS skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks and I hope you vote for me!</p>

<p>Hello everyone! My name is Vishal Parmar. One quote that could really define me and my life would be “A Monk In a Civil World” because this quote evokes the elements of simplicity and patience like a monk and the socialization and togetherness of the civil world. That’s why I love it!</p>
<p>If elected as your first-year representative my primary goal will be to make each first-year voice heard! And it will be my responsibility to represent your voices to the CCSS and the computer science community.</p>
<p>You can voice out for: </p>
<ul>
<li>Extra help with assignments</li>
<li>Doubt Solving before exams </li>
<li>Assistance with time management </li>
<li>Any issues during the year </li>
<li>Anything, And I will be my duty to help you out with it. </li>
</ul>
<p>Awesome Online First-Year!!!</p>
<p>FINDING NEW FRIENDS ONLINE will be my major priority.</p>
<p>I have visualised organising events like movie nights, trivia and fun, mid-year virtual CCSS party. To help each one of us socialise and make as many new friends even virtually. I am open to more event suggestions too!</p>
<p>For our club (CCSS)</p>
<p>If elected one of my long-term goals for the club is to organise a MyCodingGame fest. Where all of us will have a chance to create a mini-game or any project of our interest at the end of the year and have a mini fun-fair. We can all practice coding through this and even make it our side project!</p>
<p><b>Looking forward to your votes!</b></p>

<p>I’m Zara! You may have seen me around the CCSS Discord server, or just in one of the many first year classes we all share. Here’s what I’m planning as your first-year representative:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create coding competitions and hackathons for first years (for complete beginners as well as intermediate ones). Take this as an opportunity to meet new people!</li>
<li>First-year exclusive workshops led by CCSS upper year volunteers. All first years can vote on what topics/languages they want to learn about.</li>
<li>We’re missing out on our university experience. I want to do game nights and speed friending for all of us. It’s difficult to join in on activities when everyone seems to already know each other, so I want to help you all connect!</li>
<li>Create an active space for tips about specific classes, advice about beginner side projects, and a place to ask questions about things like first year or computer science.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something that I’ve had a lot of success with is being able to connect with many upper years and first years in our program, which I hope to do for ALL first years. Come find me during game nights in the CCSS Discord server! I hope to be able to make this a great first year of many. Cheers!</p>
