Have you been meaning to start developing your own projects but have no idea how to start or keep going? Or maybe you’ve already been dabbling on projects and want to share your experience and insight with programmers who are starting out? Keep reading to find out what we’ve been working on for you! 

The CCSS is thrilled to announce the launch of our official Development Mentorship Program! This project has been an idea for a long time now (going back years now!) but we are finally ready to make this a reality. 

Watch this space for our application forms! Coming out on Wednesday, January 12th.

# What do we hope to achieve?

- We want to encourage junior developers to start jumping into development projects and open source!
- One of our main goals as a society is to expand Carleton’s developer community to be larger, more collaborative and more active and this is an active way to make that happen. 
- In addition to a community, we want to create a network of developers consisting of students, alumni and connections for all of us to grow with and learn from. 
- We all get stuck sometimes. We aim to ease the learning curve from learning programming at school to working on personal projects from start to finish.
- Mentorship is an opportunity to both teach and learn and we want to facilitate these connections both naturally within the community and intentionally with creating focused development groups
- There’s so much exciting tech out there! Working together means being exposed to more unique technologies that can be hard to learn on your own.
- Developing software is a collaborative effort in industry and beyond. We want you to develop skills from becoming more familiar with git to pair programming among other collaborative practices you’ll see in industry. 
- Finally, we want to see cool projects! Working in a team means you can create something larger and more impactful than you might have been able to do on your own.

# What does a mentor do?

We are looking for mentors with the following qualifications:

- You’ve completed your first year in Computer Science!
- If you haven’t yet, the mentee role will be better suited for you so check that out below.
- You know your way around git.
- You’ve got established coding experience with your course work, side projects and/or internships. 
- You have confidence in your communication skills.
- And lastly, you’re friendly and reliable! Someone a budding developer can look up to and ask for help from. :) 

After you’ve applied, we will interview you to see if you’re a good fit for your program. If you are, we’ll proceed to the next step: matching you with mentees! Once we’ve introduced everybody and laid down expectations (preferred contact method, frequency of updates/meetings, goals, project), we’ll get the ball rolling.

Your job is to:

- Stay in touch with your mentees with the frequency and contact method you’ve all agreed on.
- This could be weekly, biweekly, daily (if you’re really passionate!) over text, voice call, video call - it’s all up to you as a team!
- Follow up on the goals your mentees have set to achieve with this project and give them a hand where and when you can
- Work on the project with your mentees directly or take on a support role whenever needed - your choice!
- Communicate your schedule and capacity to your mentees at the start and keep them updates on any changes 
- Lastly, reach out to the CCSS Board of Directors if you’re having any issues or need any help. We’re here to make this as fun and smooth as possible!

# What does a mentee do?

We are looking for mentees with the following qualifications:

- You know the fundamentals of programming (think COMP 1405 and 1406 material) and know your way around at least one programming language.
- You have ideas you want to bring to life and drive and commitment to see a project through.
- You’re not afraid to ask for help when you need it but you’re also independent enough to figure things out on your own when you can.
- You have experience working in a team (doesn’t have to be development) and understand what it takes to be a supportive and reliable teammate!

After you’ve applied, we will interview you to see if you’re a good fit for your program. If you are, we’ll proceed to the next step: matching you with mentors! Once we’ve introduced everybody and laid down expectations (preferred contact method, frequency of updates/meetings, goals, project), we’ll get the ball rolling.

Your job is to:

- Stay in touch with your mentors with the frequency and contact method you’ve all agreed on.
- This could be weekly, biweekly, daily (if you’re really passionate!) over text, voice call, video call - it’s all up to you as a team!
- Work to achieve the goals you’ve set with your mentor and ask for support when you need it!
- Make progress on your project - every little feature counts! Take it one step at a time. 
- Respect your mentor’s schedule and capacity - they have their own lives and also their own projects. Remember to be appreciative of the time they’re putting in to support you.
- Lastly, reach out to the CCSS Board of Directors if you’re having any issues or need any help. We’re here to make this as fun and smooth as possible!

# What will the CCSS do?

We’re not going to leave you all alone! We will be supervising the program and be available for all your questions and concerns - especially since this is our launch.

We’ll be around to:

- Check up on mentors and mentees biweekly to see how you’re doing
- Support groups with mediation, motivation, external support - whatever we can provide!
- Moderate the mentorship server and keep it a safe, positive space for everyone
- Hang out! Come chill with us whenever you get sick of your merge conflicts. :) 


That’s our program in detail! Thanks for reading this far and we are excited to receive all your applications once we have them up on this page on Wednesday. Good luck with your Winter term!
