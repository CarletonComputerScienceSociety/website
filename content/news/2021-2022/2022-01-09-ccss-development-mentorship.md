**Applications now open!**

Have you been meaning to start developing your own projects but have no idea how to start or keep going? Or maybe you’ve already been dabbling on projects and want to share your experience and insight with programmers who are starting out? You can now apply to become a development **mentor** or **mentee!** Applications are open until end of day **January 26th.**

[Mentee Application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfP0tNfo_15C2kPwxHumwezz-bzZ3SzQo_llRf7C4EM01HEpQ/viewform)

# What does a mentor do?

We are looking for mentors with the following qualifications:

- You’ve completed your first year in Computer Science!
- If you haven’t yet, the mentee role will be better suited for you so check that out below.
- You know your way around git.
- You’ve got established coding experience with your course work, side projects and/or internships. 
- You have confidence in your communication skills.
- And lastly, you’re friendly and reliable! Someone a budding developer can look up to and ask for help from. :) 

After you’ve applied, we will interview you to see if you’re a good fit for your program. If you are, we’ll proceed to the next step: matching you with mentees! Once we’ve introduced everybody and laid down expectations (preferred contact method, frequency of updates/meetings, goals, project), we’ll get the ball rolling.

Your job is to:

- Stay in touch with your mentees with the frequency and contact method you’ve all agreed on.
- This could be weekly, biweekly, daily (if you’re really passionate!) over text, voice call, video call - it’s all up to you as a team!
- Follow up on the goals your mentees have set to achieve with this project and give them a hand where and when you can
- Work on the project with your mentees directly or take on a support role whenever needed - your choice!
- Communicate your schedule and capacity to your mentees at the start and keep them updates on any changes 
- Lastly, reach out to the CCSS Board of Directors if you’re having any issues or need any help. We’re here to make this as fun and smooth as possible!

# What does a mentee do?

We are looking for mentees with the following qualifications:

- You know the fundamentals of programming (think COMP 1405 and 1406 material) and know your way around at least one programming language.
- You have ideas you want to bring to life and drive and commitment to see a project through.
- You’re not afraid to ask for help when you need it but you’re also independent enough to figure things out on your own when you can.
- You have experience working in a team (doesn’t have to be development) and understand what it takes to be a supportive and reliable teammate!

After you’ve applied, we will interview you to see if you’re a good fit for your program. If you are, we’ll proceed to the next step: matching you with mentors! Once we’ve introduced everybody and laid down expectations (preferred contact method, frequency of updates/meetings, goals, project), we’ll get the ball rolling.

Your job is to:

- Stay in touch with your mentors with the frequency and contact method you’ve all agreed on.
- This could be weekly, biweekly, daily (if you’re really passionate!) over text, voice call, video call - it’s all up to you as a team!
- Work to achieve the goals you’ve set with your mentor and ask for support when you need it!
- Make progress on your project - every little feature counts! Take it one step at a time. 
- Respect your mentor’s schedule and capacity - they have their own lives and also their own projects. Remember to be appreciative of the time they’re putting in to support you.
- Lastly, reach out to the CCSS Board of Directors if you’re having any issues or need any help. We’re here to make this as fun and smooth as possible!

# What will the CCSS do?

We’re not going to leave you all alone! We will be supervising the program and be available for all your questions and concerns - especially since this is our launch.

We’ll be around to:

- Check up on mentors and mentees biweekly to see how you’re doing
- Support groups with mediation, motivation, external support - whatever we can provide!
- Moderate the mentorship server and keep it a safe, positive space for everyone
- Hang out! Come chill with us whenever you get sick of your merge conflicts. :) 

That’s our program in detail, thanks for reading. Good luck with your Winter term!
