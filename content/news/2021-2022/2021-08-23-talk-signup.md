If you're interested in becoming a speaker, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1H1s_0tMzakN2Dp34PSjJYDpYd2oVYrADLxpOI3mOzaE/edit). We'll be in touch with you soon!

We are looking for students of all experience levels and year standings (including incoming first years)  who are interested in giving presentations. No prior presentation or tech talk experience is required.

Your presentation could discuss a personal project, new technology, work experience, research, or really anything you've learned that you feel would be beneficial to your fellow computer science students.

To see some of the previous presentations the CCSS has hosted, visit our [talks page](/events/talks).
