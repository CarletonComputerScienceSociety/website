# Ciphered Journey


1. Head to the campus card office and take a selfie in front of it. Keep note of the floor that the office is on.
2. Alrighty, you have most likely received your campus card. You should probably explore your building a bit to get to know where all your fellow computer science students hang out. Head to Herzberg, and take a selfie in front of the sign. Make sure to take a selfie in front of the sign that has the building number on it, because the number is important, you want to keep a note of it.\
3. You've met up with your fellow computer scientists, but now it's time to get some work done. Head to the library and take a selfie in front of it. How many floors does the library have? You'll want to keep a note of it!\
4. Great work! Now this is where those numbers you kept a note of come in handy! Use those numbers to form one number, and add Hewlett-Packard in front of it. Or actually, the acronym. Once you figure it out, you can probably guess what you need to do.
5. ???
