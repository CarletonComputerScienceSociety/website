Hey, first-years!

You may have heard some talk over the past few days about first year reps. But what is a first year rep, and what does it entail to hold one such position? For the CCSS, First Year Reps are the voice of the first-year students in computer science. They help advertise our events to new students, and they can run events and initiatives of their own as well. First Year Reps are members of the CCSS Board of Directors, and get to have a say on all important decisions.

With the turn of the academic year, we are looking for two first-year computer science students to become the new First Year Reps. These are elected positions, and they will be chosen by the first-year CS student body. Nominations are open until Friday, September 14. The following weekend, eligible candidates will go through an interview process, with the campaigning period active from Monday, September 17 to Friday, September 21. Finally, voting will take place online from Tuesday, September 25 to Friday, September 28.

If you are interested in running for First Year Rep, please fill out the application form (linked below) by Friday, September 14.
