The notable changes are:
1. The addition of a new elected position entitled "Director of Inclusion", whose mandate is to promote and represent diversity initiatives within the society
2. References to a new standing document entitled The Electoral Code, which establishes rules on how the CCSS general elections are to run each year
3. Slight changes to formatting and wording to make the Constitution more readable, without altering the sense (except with the changes mentioned above)

Linked below are the relevant documents.
- [Revised CCSS Constitution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qjUtn-7BfmmLniZZDFm3mfygoKr1cPsf8yWleRk_baU/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Proposed Electroal Code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v66nTxoRgAYNnXLr3ZIAhjkyiHMRGUoK3rH9rmLL478/edit?usp=sharing)

You may find our current Constitution under the [Governance section of the CCSS website](http://ccss.carleton.ca/about/governance/)

In order to ratify the proposed changes, each change must undergo a 2/3rds majority vote by all full CCSS members present at the General Meeting. Please attend so you may ensure that your voice is heard!

See you all on Friday!
