# CCSS Summer Dev Projects

This summer, the CCSS is running several "summer dev projects". This gives
Carleton students several projects to contribute to over the summer, which are
designed to help other students. You can read more about the projects on [this
Notion
document](https://angelonfira.notion.site/CCSS-Dev-Projects-Summer-2022-d0284164d0ae4a4f8bbdd43783f4c09e).

This blog post will introduce some of the students behind these projects. Any
student can participate, and many are in different years of university. There
are also many different skill sets in use, with development to the frontend of
websites, backend web servers, and even some other tooling in the middle.

The projects are all open source, so [feel free to check them out for
yourself](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety?type=source)!

## Introductions

### Forest Anderson ([@AngelOnFira](https://github.com/angelonfira))

Hi! I‚Äôm Forest üëã

I‚Äôm a computer science student with honours in game development at Carleton
University in Ottawa, Canada üá®üá¶ I love running any events in the game,
security, backend, and cloud spaces. Some of my favorites are game jams,
security CTFs, and interactive cloud workshops.

On the side, I also do lots of open source work in the Rustlang ecosystem ü¶Ä I‚Äôm
part of the Rust Gamedev Working Group, and the team lead of the Rust CTCFT
team. I‚Äôm also one of the core developers on Veloren, an open source game
similar to Minecraft. In the Rust community, I run a monthly game dev meetup,
and co-edit the monthly game dev newsletter.

### Nguyen-Hanh Nong ([@Nguyen-HanhNong](https://github.com/Nguyen-HanhNong))

Sup, my name is Nguyen-Hanh. ü§ù

I'm an honours computer science student at Carleton University, specializing in
A.I. and Machine Learning. I spend my free time mostly playing video games (love
emulating old games) and playing music (üéπ)

I've previously worked on some front-end and website-related projects. With the
CCSS, I'm currently working on a couple of projects, mainly focusing on
improving the Autograder project and developing parts of the CCSS website. üèÅ

### Steven Kim ([@kyonghokim93](https://github.com/kyonghokim93))

Hi, I‚Äôm Steven!

I‚Äôm a CarletonU alumni with MA in Applied Linguistics who is now a CompSci
student at Algonquin College. I am still new to many CompSci concepts, and I am
excited to learn as much as I can.

I am interested in making my own Roguelike in the future, something similar to
Darkest Dungeon with Lovecraftian horror theme. My favorite game of all time is
Ratchet and Clank.

Nice to meet you!

### Victor Li ([@VictorLi5611](https://github.com/VictorLi5611))

Hey, y'all!! My name is Victor.

Currently, I'm a 3rd year CS student w/ honors in the AI stream and a minor in
Mathematics at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. I'm also the Director of
Finance or Treasurer of the Carleton Computer Science Society, where I manage
our finances and merch. I'm also from Toronto and moved to Ottawa to study at
Carleton!! In my spare time, I like to read manga, watch anime, and play some
chess. If it's sunny out, I also kayak and bike around Ottawa.

I can't wait to work with you all and might see you in person in the fall
semester!!

### Areej ([@areej-i](https://github.com/areej-i))

Hi! I‚Äôm Areej :)

I'm going into my 4th year of computer science at Carleton, and I'm from
Toronto.

In my free time, I like to make rugs and paint. And probably spend too much time
on TikTok.

### Julie Wechsler ([@juliewex](https://github.com/ghoulie-jpg))
