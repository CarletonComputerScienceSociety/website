Hey everyone, Forest here!

It's almost time for the Autumn of Rust 🍂🦀! This is a (free) student-run
course that I just taught over the summer, and I'm bringing it back for the fall
semester!

I wanted to run this course since there are several concepts in the Rust
language that we don't (currently) learn in courses at Carleton. This includes a
lot of topics in:

- language safety (begone segfaults!)
- concurrency (what if threading wasn't scary? 👻)
- functional programming (`iter().filter().map()`...).

I also do a lot of work in the Rust world too! I'm a lead of the [Rust Gamedev
Working Group](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/wgs/gamedev), I work on a
flagship Rust game called [Veloren](https://veloren.net/), and I help to
organize the [Cross Team Collaboration Fun Times (CTCFT)
meetup](https://rust-lang.github.io/ctcft/). Rust has a great ecosystem, and I'd
love to share it with you!

To join in on this course, you'll find the registration link at the bottom of
[this Notion
document](https://angelonfira.notion.site/Autumn-of-Rust-267faebf7259486fbf505f64de87b551),
along with a lot of other useful information.

Hope to see you this Autumn!
