## What is CUSEC?
The Canadian University Software Engineering Conference (CUSEC) is an annual student-run tech conference that brings together students from across Canada to learn from industry leaders, connect with like-minded peers, and discover career opportunities with sponsoring companies including **RBC**, **Nokia**, **CSE**, and more.


CUSEC 2026 will take place at the **Hotel Omni Mont-Royal** in Montréal from **Thursday, January 8th to Saturday, January 10th**.

For more information, please visit their website: [CUSEC 2026](https://2026.cusec.net/).


## Funding Opportunity
The CCSS is excited to fund a selected group of students to attend CUSEC this year! Our goal is to support students who are passionate about software engineering, actively looking for employment opportunities, and interested in getting involved with the tech community across Canada. 


We will cover the cost of the conference ticket for selected students. If you accept funding, you will be responsible for covering the **rest of the costs** (accommodation, travel, food). You can find an estimated cost breakdown of these items [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi6Rn_MaHrJ6SNbqp2YqO3RjRWBP3eB7K18M-sr12hY/edit?tab=t.0).

## Important Notes
Please note that we will **only** be funding students under the School of Computer Science.

If you are selected, you are responsible for responding to our email confirming your spot within **48 hours**. If you do not confirm your ticket, we may offer it to another student.
