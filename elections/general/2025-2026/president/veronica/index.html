I’m Veronica, the current president and previous first-year representative, and I am running with hopes of being re-elected as CCSS president for the coming year!</p><p>If I am re-elected, the following is what I would hope to accomplish during my term:</p><h3 id=ensuring-proper-use-of-levy-funds>Ensuring Proper Use of Levy Funds</h3><p>Throughout the past couple of years, we have been vouching for the establishment of a levy fee of $2.50/term for full-time students - in hopes of maintaining the operational baseline that the CCSS maintains.</p><p>As I served as the Chair of the YES committee, and helped ensure that the levy referendum passed last year - I am highly committed to ensuring that the money that we receive from students benefits you the most.</p><p>As this year is the first year that this is going to be in place - it is essential that a proper basis is set, making sure that the funds are spent sustainably in the future.</p><h3 id=increasing-development-opportunities>Increasing Development Opportunities</h3><p>Because of the effects of the recent pandemic on the community, there are fewer opportunities to build projects and get development experience.</p><p>What I plan to do to improve this:</p><ul><li>Day-long development sprint events - as not everyone has the opportunity to commit to a multi-day hackathon, I suggest that we offer opportunities for students to create mini-projects within the span of a day. This gives students the benefit of learning alongside others in a non-academic setting, as well as the opportunity to meet peers that they might not otherwise.</li><li>Month-long development events - since hackathons don’t really let you build something very robust because of time constraints, offering students an event where we give a prompt and give students a month to create a project based on the prompt will offer a different experience.</li></ul><h3 id=increasing-accessibility>Increasing Accessibility</h3><p>Everyone has instances where they might want to go to a certain event, but they might not be able to make it because of timing constraints, or maybe they cannot make it to campus for that particular time.</p><p>What I suggest we do about this:</p><ul><li>Hybrid approach to events - when possible, we offer an option to tune in online via Zoom or some other platform.</li><li>Recording events - if we are offering an online/hybrid option for an event, this also opens the opportunity to record events through that platform</li><li>Online events - during the pandemic, there were online events offered, as on-campus events were not possible. I suggest that we bring back some of these events, such as speed-friending!</li></ul><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read this far, and I hope you have a lovely rest of your term!</p><p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at <a href=mailto:veronica.mordvinova@ccss.carleton.ca>veronica.mordvinova@ccss.carleton.ca</a> :)</p><noscript><img src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/pixel.gif></noscript><script defer src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/script.js></script></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:bod@ccss.carleton.ca>bod@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
