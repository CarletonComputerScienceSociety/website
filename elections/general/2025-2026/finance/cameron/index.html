I’m Cameron, and I’m running to be your Director of Finance for the 2024-2025 term. With the introduction of a new levy and the continued growth of our society, it’s more important than ever that we have solid financial management and strategic planning in place. I want to make sure your contributions are used fairly, and that computer science students can be proud to be a part of the CCSS.</p><p>Here’s what I plan to do if elected:</p><h3 id=properly-manage-the-new-levy-and-ensure-transparency->Properly Manage the new Levy and Ensure Transparency 💰</h3><p>With the new levy being introduced in the Fall, one of my top priorities will be to ensure that every cent is spent wisely and in alignment with the needs of the society.</p><p>I will put in place strong financial oversight and accountability measures, ensuring transparency in how funds are spent.
I will also regularly update the society on our financial standing and make sure there is open communication about how your money is being used.</p><h3 id=work-with-the-director-of-industry-initiatives-to-scout-sponsorships--new-funding-sources->Work with the Director of Industry Initiatives to Scout Sponsorships & New Funding Sources 🤝</h3><p>To increase the resources available for our events, I will collaborate closely with the Director of Industry Initiatives to secure new sponsorships and funding opportunities. By expanding partnerships with companies and organizations, we can fund larger-scale events, provide more resources, and curate a wider range of opportunities for students.</p><h3 id=release-ccss-merchandise->Release CCSS Merchandise 🎽</h3><p>I know many of you have been waiting for CCSS merchandise, and I’m committed to getting this out to you. I will prioritize getting our merchandise (including hoodies, beanies, and other fun items) produced and available for sale without further delays. Not only will this help build our community spirit, but the sales will also provide extra support to continue with our events and services.</p><h3 id=budget-for-society-lounge-improvements->Budget for Society Lounge Improvements 🛋️</h3><p>The lounge is a space that many of us rely on, and I want to make sure it continues to meet the needs of the community.
I will work on budgeting for necessary improvements, whether that’s upgrading furniture, adding new amenities, or enhancing the overall atmosphere. I’ll make sure to gather feedback from the lounge’s regulars to understand what changes you want to see.</p><p>Thank you for your support, and I hope to serve as your Director of Finance in the upcoming year! If you have any questions or concerns, find me in the lounge or reach out to me here:</p><p>Email: <a href=mailto:cameron.stirrup@ccss.carleton.ca>cameron.stirrup@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p><p>Discord: <a href=discord://-/users/142782738615762944>@mrribcage</a></p><noscript><img src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/pixel.gif></noscript><script defer src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/script.js></script></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:info@ccss.carleton.ca>info@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
