My name is Aditya but you probably know me as Jacc. I’ve been involved as a volunteer with the CCSS throughout my time at Carleton, and I would like to continue next year as your Director of Academics!</p><p>Here are some of the highlights from my platform.

I will work on adding support for other CS courses, starting with the courses most students struggle with, such as COMP 1805 and COMP 2402.</p><h3 id=-delivering-student-feedback-directly-to-instructors>📢 <a href="https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69#1a67fd7bee2680d78821fe0250ddba70:~:text=2%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%20Communicating%20Student%20Feedback%20for%20CS%20Courses">Delivering Student Feedback Directly to Instructors</a></h3><p>Currently, there aren’t many accessible ways for students to provide feedback about courses to the School of Computer Science. I would like to communicate feedback regarding some of the biggest issues with certain courses during my term as the director of academics, while also implementing a long term solution for consistently passing on student feedback to course instructors</p><h3 id=-improving-study-sessions>📚 <a href="https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69#1a67fd7bee2680d78821fe0250ddba70:~:text=3%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%20Improving%20Study%20Sessions">Improving Study Sessions</a></h3><p>I will continue to organize study sessions for COMP and MATH courses, while also working to improve their format and organization.</p><h3 id=-reworked-schedule-for-career-focused-events>💼 <a href="https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69#1a67fd7bee2680d78821fe0250ddba70:~:text=1%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%20Improved%20Schedule%20for%20Career%20Focused%20Events">Reworked Schedule for Career Focused Events</a></h3><p>Many of our career focused presentations take place in January, which is when students are already in the process of applying to summer internships.

I will both introduce new initiatives and bring back older ones to help students learn more about research opportunities as well as make connections with professors that can potentially supervise them.</p><h3 id=-resources-for-finding-internships>📝 <a href="https://separated-octagon-953.notion.site/Jacc-s-Campaign-Platform-CCSS-Director-of-Academics-1a67fd7bee268008854ce58fb65f9c69#1a67fd7bee2680d78821fe0250ddba70:~:text=3%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%20Resources%20for%20Finding%20Internships">Resources for Finding Internships</a></h3><p>Some information from the COOP 1000 course does not really apply to the process of finding tech jobs.
