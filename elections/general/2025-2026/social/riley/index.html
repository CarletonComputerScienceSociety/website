My name is Riley Lutz, and I‚Äôm excited to announce my candidacy for Director of Social for the 2025-2026 academic year.</p><p>I know that social interaction plays a vital role in our academic success and well-being. Whether it‚Äôs collaborating on that one vexing group project, networking for our career, or just doing a bit of trolling in the CCSS lounge, staying connected with peers is part of what makes our CS journey worth experiencing.</p><p>My goal as Director of Social is to create engaging events that help students build friendships, develop communication skills, and make lasting memories - all while fostering a strong sense of community within our club. Here‚Äôs some ways I plan to make this happen:</p><h3 id=competitive-team-activities->Competitive Team Activities üèÖ</h3><p>One of the best ways to learn and grow in computer science is through a little friendly competition! I plan to organize team-based events that challenge participants while keeping things fun and engaging. Some ideas include coding tug of war matches, capture the flag games, and relay-based coding races! These&rsquo;ll give us a chance to sharpen up our skills while engaging in a tad of friendly rivalry!</p><h3 id=social-mixers->Social Mixers üëã</h3><p>It can be easy to catch a case of tunnel vision when on the course grind, so I want to create welcoming spaces where you can meet professors, upper-years, and those in your own year in a relaxed setting. Some examples of this would be Icebreaker activities, &ldquo;ask me anything&rdquo; panels, and speed friending, not to mention first-year oriented events!</p><h3 id=gaming-tournaments--socials->Gaming Tournaments & Socials üïπÔ∏è</h3><p>Gaming is something many of us just don&rsquo;t get tired of, and I want to make sure that we continue to host events that let students lock in and show what they&rsquo;re made of! If elected, I will do my best to cater to both the casual and competitive gaming audience, via party game nights (Jackbox, Smash Brothers, draw.io), structured tourneys(Valorant, Marvel Rivals, Overwatch) and more!</p><h3 id=outdoor--physical-activities->Outdoor / Physical Activities ü§∏</h3><p>Us computer scientists have to unstick ourselves from those screens at some point, so as Director of Social I would put an emphasis on events allowing us to touch a bit of grass and get back in touch with nature! To start off, I feel like students often don&rsquo;t feel incentivised to explore Ottawa&rsquo;s paths and trails, so some hikes and trail walks would be something I would put together throughout the year. Organizing recreational sports matches, ice skating, swimming, and group gym workouts to get the blood pumping are some other ideas I&rsquo;d put into practice in this position.</p><p>As Director of Social, my priority would be to make our club a place where everyone feels welcome, engaged and involved in our community. I want to hear your thoughts as well - this club is for all of us, after all! I aim to maintain an open-door policy and keep my ear close to the ground for the next big idea, so please don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out!</p><noscript><img src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/pixel.gif></noscript><script defer src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/script.js></script></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:bod@ccss.carleton.ca>bod@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
