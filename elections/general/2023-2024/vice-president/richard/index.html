Some of you may know me from COMP 2406, as I have been a TA for 2406 4 times in a row. Or you may have seen me from SSSC (Science Student Success Centre). Where I have been mentoring CS students needing academic advice and running workshops and events, such as the Carleton Coding Challenge (I hope yall had fun in this!).</p><p>Here are a few things I would like to achieve if I am elected as a Vice President:</p><ol><li><p>Creating a Healthy Workflow for CCSS</p><p>This would be the most important duty as the main task of a Vice President would be to act as a &lsquo;COO&rsquo; to assist the President, who would be more of a &lsquo;CEO&rsquo;. In the past, I had various experiences in managing a team. I have been part of student associations and served as a president for a club for multiple years, and currently am a Team Lead in SSSC. Using those experiences, I will be able to organize the CCSS&rsquo;s workflow to assist the President and guide individual board members to create a healthy workflow.</p></li><li><p>Strengthen the Organizational Structure</p><p>Based on my experiences with other student organizations, it is very important to have a solid organizational structure. If elected, I would like to reinforce our structure by thinking of ways to incorporate more volunteers, and/or making changes to the positions available.</p></li><li><p>Extra Study Resources</p><p>Personally, discretemath.ca developed by CCSS was the only reason I got out of 2804 alive. So I am looking to expand that into other tough courses in CS such as 3000, and 3804. Obviously, this will require discussing with the faculty and the professors. But I believe it is worth a try, as the benefit it will give to CS students is immeasurable.</p></li><li><p>More Merch!</p><p>It is very common to see CS students representing CCSS around the campus by wearing the hoodies. I would like to have more products available to increase more options for those wanting to join in.</p></li><li><p>Mental Health Support</p><p>It is not a secret that our program is rigorous. There are tons of us who heavily lack sleep, and suffer from mental health concerns due to the assignments, tests, grades, and of course, Coop as well. I am deeply concerned about this issue, and will further promote mental wellness during my time at CCSS.</p></li><li><p>Support for Non-Traditional CS Students</p><p>People join CS for various reasons, at various times in their lives. While most of us are straight from high school, there are some of us who have returned to school after a degree, or even two. As a non-traditional CS student myself (I am a transfer student from a life science degree), I intend to make Carleton CS more inclusive for those of us starting a new adventure.</p></li></ol><p>Feel free to contact me via email (<a href=mailto:richardkim@cmail.carleton.ca>richardkim@cmail.carleton.ca</a>) if you have any questions or want to discuss my platform!</p><p>Richard Kim</p></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:info@ccss.carleton.ca>info@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
