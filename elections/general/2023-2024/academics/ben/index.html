My name is Ben, and I’m currently in 1st year. Although I may not have much experience within the university, I believe that I can help contribute to your academic success. Computer science is a hard program to get through, but as Director of Academics, I want to make YOUR life easier.</p><p>Here are some ideas I have to meet that goal:</p><p><strong>Course-specific study groups</strong></p><p>There are a lot of courses that could benefit from organized group study. Sometimes it really helps to have a place where everyone can come together and share their ideas in preparation for a test/assignment. This is something I plan on continuing throughout the academic year, and I would be open to organizing one as soon as there is enough demand.</p><p><strong>Upper-year Panels</strong></p><p>My plan is to pick up where Sh*t I Wish I Knew left off, but with a more academic focus. These panels would be a perfect chance for upper-year students to share any specific study tips, resources, and anything else about a certain course they’ve taken. Speaking from personal experience, I believe that this advice is extremely valuable - especially for new university students, but really for anyone taking any course.</p><p><strong>Career Development Workshops</strong></p><p>Knowing how to sell yourself is a key part in finding any job/co-op position. Creative resume writing, interview performance, and networking tips and workshops can all help. These will hopefully give you guys a head start on finding your all-important first job, and I’m sure we can all use a boost in these fields.</p><p>While the above are some ideas I had for the year, YOU are still my main source of inspiration. Everything I mentioned above is open to your feedback, and I welcome any new suggestions or comments. This isn’t a one-man show: We’re in this together, so let’s make the best of our studies! You can reach out anytime with questions, and I’ll be happy to answer them.</p><p>Where you can reach me:</p><p>Discord: (i am yu#3711)</p><p>Instagram: ben.yk.yu</p><p>Email: <a href=mailto:benjaminyu3@cmail.carleton.ca>benjaminyu3@cmail.carleton.ca</a></p></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
