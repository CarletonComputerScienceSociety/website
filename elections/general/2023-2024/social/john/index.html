My name’s John. I’m the CCSS First Year Representative and a current Board of Directors.</p><p>Over the course of the school year, I’ve hosted a <a href=https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2022-2023/2022-10-13-lounge-games-night/>games night</a>, <a href=https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2022-2023/2022-12-07-1405-study-session/>multiple study sessions</a>, <a href=https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2022-2023/2023-02-02-communal-project/>discord project development meetings</a>, and had a hand in many other events. I’ve seen what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. As the Director of Social, I’d have a few plans for the CCSS!</p><p><strong>A Warm and Welcoming Community for All 🛋️</strong></p><p>A lot of us haven’t really been able to connect with the CCSS. When you walk in, you don’t really know anyone. Some students are talking about complex topics and industry drama that you know nothing about! Additionally, volunteers feel like they’ve gotten ghosted or left on-read multiple times. As the Director of Social, I would make sure students feel included and have tasks.</p><p><strong>Mini Career Fair 🤝</strong></p><p>The CCSS has had a “Find Your First Tech Job” presentation, but what if we could do a little more? It’d be awesome to host a Computer Science-Specific Career Fair. Students can meet employers and if you’re already going to another career fair, you can use this one as your mock run and see how you’d fare!</p><p><strong>CS Club Expo and Collabs 💻</strong></p><p>This year, a lot of students haven’t been able to hear a lot about other CS related clubs. The AI Society, Carleton Competitive Programming Club, and Women in Computer Science all host events but don’t get enough attention. As the social director, I would host a club expo closer to the start of the year and event collabs for all that are interested.</p><p><strong>Games Night 🎮</strong></p><p>The <a href=https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2022-2023/2022-10-13-lounge-games-night/>First Year Games Night</a> I hosted went pretty well. The interactive format really brings out the best in people. I’ll continue to go in this direction but it won’t just be card games and only first years anymore. I’ll expand the scope with more games like GarcticPhone, Among Us, Mafia, and a whole lot more.</p><p><strong>Prof Night and Coffee Socials 🍵</strong></p><p>All of the past professor-related social events have been major successes, but I only noticed a couple profs coming in every time. I intend to host socials at a more convenient time for both students and professors.</p><p><strong>Upholding Speed-Friending 😀</strong></p><p>I think it’s really important for students of all years to get to know each other. Chatting online is nice and all, but I’ll be moving it towards a more fun direction. Discord Minigames is a real bop! Team building and light competition are great ways to meet people.</p><p>I want to make a real difference in the community, and as the Director of Social, I’ll be sure to do all this and more for you guys</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>John Lu</p><noscript><img src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/pixel.gif></noscript><script defer src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/script.js></script></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:bod@ccss.carleton.ca>bod@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
