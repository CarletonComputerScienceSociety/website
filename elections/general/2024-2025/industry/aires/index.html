As your first-year representative, I have ran several events related to networking, and I look forward to boost my impact as the Director of Industry initiatives. As the first Director of Industry Initiatives, I will be expanding on the events I planned this year and more.</p><h4 id=resume-review>📝Resume Review📝</h4><p>This year, I organized the first resume roast at the beginning of the year where I invited a graduate student with FANG experience as well as two other reviewers with startup experience to come in as resume reviewers.
As the Director of Industry Initiatives, instead of having students as resume reviewers, I will be inviting recruiters and HR from tech companies to review your resumes.</p><h4 id=industry-info-sessions>👩🏻‍💻Industry Info Sessions👩🏻‍💻</h4><p>Many students I&rsquo;ve met have expressed their interest in cybersecurity but do not know what it entails, and how to get involved. So I invited the WICS chair, Melissa, who won first place in Ottawa for cybersecurity competitions (ICC and ECSC), to prepare a presentation on how students can learn from her coop and competing experience. I also invited an admin from the Cybersecurity club, Will, to go over the workshops that students can attend to learn cybersecurity hands-on.
Next year, instead of just co-op students, I will host events with tech companies to allow you to learn more about industry opportunities, and network directly with the company to discover what they are looking for in candidates and get career advice. Look forward to chatting with representatives and panel events!</p><h4 id=workshops-with-tech-companies>💻Workshops with Tech Companies💻</h4><p>I will host collaborations with companies to host workshops for you to connect with industry professionals while also adding experience to your resume and discover different technologies.</p><p>I know students, especially in Computer Science, understand the importance of networking, but also how difficult it is to start and how much more accessible it becomes when clubs like CCSS organize these events. As your first-year rep, I enjoyed organizing networking-related events and look forward to doing so again next year!</p><p>Reach out to me on Instagram if you want to say hi!</p><pre style="font-family:source sans pro,sans-serif">@_.heiress._</pre><noscript><img src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/pixel.gif></noscript><script defer src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/script.js></script></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:info@ccss.carleton.ca>info@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
