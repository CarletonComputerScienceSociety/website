0. About me - In Highschool and Pre-University College (outside of Canada), I have held positions on faculties, councils and clubs most notably President of Student Council, District Leader for the Red Crescent / Red Cross Association and Youth Camp Lead. I’ve actively competed in many STEM and Innovation based competitions with a side of Debating / Public speaking. Having experience in running and participating in events from competitions, workshops to various social events, I wish to bring and share my experiences into the CCSS.</p><p>When elected:</p><ol><li>Will ensure events hosted are more accessible events for everyone, on and off campus, study term and work term.</li></ol><ul><li>more Hackathons scaled Up and Down to cater for all experience levels</li><li>systematic study sessions for dire courses, midterms and finals</li><li>career and future talks, LinkedIn and Resume workshops and guides</li><li>social activities, rock climbing?!, gatherings, chill talks, good vibes, free food</li></ul><ol start=2><li><p>Will aim for more direct to consumer info about events that all CS students should know of and should take full advantage of. Currently only through Discord, monthly/bimonthly email, CCSS website and Instagram, events shared may sometimes be missed. Some events have participant caps that fill quicker than others. Being able to choose which events interest you, allow for more customization on what events we push for and advertise to you.</p></li><li><p>Will strive to allow any CS Students, be it a frequent CCSS participant or anyone who just recently found out about the CCSS to be involved in more volunteering activities for the events hosted. Volunteering for events, making new friends and connections, socializing with the society, helping out the CS department in general and more.</p></li><li><p>Will attempt in optimizing and cleaning internal processes for hosted events, in hopes for all students in CS to have a clearer view on how the CCSS runs things.</p></li></ol><p><em><strong>TL;DR - Your Interest = Our Events : Better Notifications : More Events, More Volunteers : Transparency in Events.</strong></em></p><p>Everything I’ve mentioned, are experiences that I have had with the CCSS, and wish for everyone to be able to experience the same and more.
Happy Voting!! You’ll see me either way, either as a volunteer, as a nominee next term, most probably both!!</p><p>If you have any questions or just want to chat, feel free to DM me on discord, username: dymon.</p><noscript><img src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/pixel.gif></noscript><script defer src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/script.js></script></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:bod@ccss.carleton.ca>bod@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
