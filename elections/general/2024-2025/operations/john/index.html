I‚Äôm your current Social Director and former First Year Rep.</p><p>In my two years at the CCSS, I&rsquo;ve hosted many events for our community, If elected, I will improve the behind-the-scenes operations of the CCSS to ensure a continued delivery of high-quality events and services to all computer science students.</p><h4 id=-hosting-a-balanced-variety-of-events>‚òÅÔ∏è Hosting a Balanced Variety of Events</h4><p>We‚Äôve had an imbalance of events in terms of the kinds of events. Academic vs social vs industry. If elected, I will ensure that we have a balanced mix of events that cater to all students.</p><ul style=margin-top:-.75rem><li>Hosting industry initiatives like networking events with Solace or Kinaxis for students to connect with employers.<li>To alleviate study stress, let's organize games nights and movie nights!<li>More meaningful long-term projects would not only enhance students' skills but also enrich the CCSS community.</ul><h4 id=improving-our-volunteer-experience>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èImproving Our Volunteer Experience</h4><p>As of now, volunteers don&rsquo;t have the best experience. They aren‚Äôt sure where they fit into the society? If elected, I will ensure that volunteers know how to involve themselves in a healthy and productive manner.</p><ul style=margin-top:-.75rem><li>We'll match volunteers with experienced executives, so volunteers can dip their toes in some of our operations safely. Executives also gain mentorship opportunities.<li>Monthly feedback sessions from volunteers will be prioritized to gather input on how we can enhance our operations.<li>Let's diversify volunteer opportunities beyond just lounge duties. We're exploring roles such as announcement and logistics volunteers, allowing you to explore your interests and contribute in multiple ways.</ul><h4 id=-scaling-up-events--collabs>‚¨ÜÔ∏è Scaling Up Events & Collabs</h4><p>We&rsquo;ve seen a significant increase in the number of events we&rsquo;ve hosted this year. If elected, I will ensure that we have the resources and infrastructure to scale up our events and collaborations with other organizations.</p><ul style=margin-top:-.75rem><li>Collabs would significantly boost attendance. Our events typically draw 20-30 attendees. My Cross-Club Potluck & Games Night garnered an attendance of up to 100 people.</li><li>Collaborations ensure better funding for our events. With each event usually allotted a mere $20 budget, pooling resources with other clubs allows us to afford prizes, equipment, and refreshments. For instance, Hack The Tunnels required a budget of $3000, which could have been less burdensome with contributions from other clubs.</li><li>Collaborations foster a stronger sense of community. By collaborating, we can create a vibrant community where students can engage in various activities beyond the CCSS.</li></ul><h4 id=-planning-ahead-of-time>üóìÔ∏è Planning Ahead of Time</h4><p>As of now, events are only planned a few weeks in advance. If elected, I will ensure that we plan events at least a month in advance to ensure that we can deliver high-quality events to our community.</p><ul style=margin-top:-.75rem><li>Planning ahead ensures that we secure event venues well in advance, giving us ample time to announce the location two weeks ahead.</li><li>Planning ahead will allow us to trust volunteer with more responsibilities such as room booking, poster creation, and presentation development</li></ul><p>Feel free to message me on Discord (JohnLu2004)</p></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:info@ccss.carleton.ca>info@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
