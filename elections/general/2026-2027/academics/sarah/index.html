I&rsquo;m Sarah and I&rsquo;m currently going into my second year of computer science in the cyber security stream.</p><p>    I want to run as Director of Academics at the Carleton Computer Science Society. I&rsquo;ve always been really passionate about creating an environment for my fellow peers where they feel supported, safe and empowered to succeed. Throughout my time in Carleton as a computer science student, I understand that right academic support is really important to succeed. A quiet place to study with like-minded people, access to practice problems, and a conversation with a person in the field can make the difference between feeling overwhelmed and feeling capable. I want to help build that support system for others. What really intrigued me about this position was its collaborative nature, and the fact that I&rsquo;m going to be able to work and connect with many people.</p><p>    If elected one of my top priorities would be to expand the study sessions. I would make it so that it has a clear schedule prioritizing midterm and finals season so people can drop in whenever they need help. I will also recruit upper-year students who have done well in the course to lead these study sessions and offer advice. In addition to that, I would love to highlight different academic pathways beyond coursework, such as undergraduate research, internships and graduate programs. Hosting Q&amp;A sessions or a discussion board with professors and other students who have pursued these opportunities can be helpful to students who didn’t know about these pathways and encourage them to explore beyond it as well. Overall, I am committed to making academic support more accessible and visible within the computer science community at Carleton. I don’t want students to feel alone in their academic journey and that there are always resources and people ready to support them.</p><p>Thank you so much for your consideration and have a great day!</p><noscript><img src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/pixel.gif></noscript><script defer src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/script.js></script></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:bod@ccss.carleton.ca>bod@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
