I would be honoured to continue in this role to help further your experience here at Carleton University and with the society while also simultaneously continuing to support the behind-the-scenes here at the Carleton Computer Science Society.</p><p>During my time here, I have volunteered with the CCSS at numerous events and also continuously attended meetings and contributed to various discussions and initiatives. I previously ran for Director of Operations last year because I knew I wanted to contribute even more and help others in my program feel more comfortable, supported and welcomed while also supporting and ensuring everything stays on track at the CS society. I believe having a society / club that runs events and services and that also creates content and resources for the student population it represents will truly help make the University experience even better.</p><p>If re-elected, I plan to:</p><h3 id=1-continue-to-support-volunteers->1. Continue to support volunteers 🤝</h3><p>I wish to support students by answering any question they may have and ensuring all students have the opportunity to contribute and help out when needed and when they are interested. I will ensure students are given proper and constant support on whatever they do in regards to the society and will be sure to schedule and assign them appropriately depending on what they are interested in and their availability. This would apply to Lounge shifts and operations, Hackathons, major events and smaller scale initiatives and I would ensure volunteers have all the information they need to complete their tasks accordingly.</p><h3 id=2-represent-students-voices-and-visions->2. Represent students voices and visions 🗣️</h3><p>Continuously seek out student feedback and open discussions in order to ensure the wants, needs and concerns of students are met in the society by releasing feedback forms, reaching out to volunteers and promoting appropriate discussion in-person and online.</p><h3 id=3-promote-the-ccss-lounge->3. Promote the CCSS Lounge 🛋️</h3><p>Located at Herzberg 4135, this is a space that is designed to provide a comfortable and welcoming environment for CS and Cybersecurity students to relax, chat and create new relationships and connections. I plan to pursue promoting and supporting lounge initiatives by hosting more events in the room, managing operations and upgrades related to the lounge to elevate the space along with publicly promoting the room more so more people are aware of it and can benefit from it.</p><p>I am always open to new ideas and suggestions! If you have any questions, thoughts or concerns please feel free to reach out! I am almost always in the CCSS Lounge and you can also find me in the CCSS Discord Server :)</p><noscript><img src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/pixel.gif></noscript><script defer src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/script.js></script></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:bod@ccss.carleton.ca>bod@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
