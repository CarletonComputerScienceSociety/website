As such, I would love to bring that passion to the board of directors this year as we transition from this weird online/in-person phase.</p><p>You may know me from having been your TA, from CUSEC as the Head Delegate for Carleton University (hang tight for the swag, it’ll reach you very soon 👀), as the Communications Officer for the CCSS, or even just in general from the CCSS Discord server. You may even have come to a couple of the events that I helped organize for the CCSS in the past, such as Questionable (the real-life Among Us), CCSS Jeopardy, CCSS Cook-Off, Tournament Night, and so on. I’ve been involved with the CCSS ever since I started at Carleton, starting as a volunteer on various committees and continuing as Communications Officer this year. I’ve absolutely loved my journey with the CCSS so far and would be thrilled to continue this journey. If elected, I want to introduce brand new types of social initiatives to the CCSS, initiatives that not only help students have fun within their own discipline of Computer Science, but also expand to other disciplines, such as arts, music, business, etc., while keeping the fun social aspect to it!</p><p>There is certainly a lot of doubts surrounding the transition to in-person activities and in such an uncertain time, it becomes difficult to plan for the mode of delivery. However, I’ve got you covered! Most of the initiatives that I want to start and events that I want to run work both in-person and online, or even in a hybrid model.</p><p>Here is a short list of the many initiatives that I want to start and events that I want to run:</p><ul><li>The Amazing Race: Code Edition</li><li>CCSS Picassos</li><li>Music Sharing Series</li><li>Beat Making Nights</li><li>Business-ify</li><li>Party Game Nights</li><li>Board Game Nights</li><li>Podcast-style Speed Friending</li></ul><p>and much much more!</p><p>Oh, and international students, I know it’s not too ideal to attend an event at 3AM. As such, I’ll try my very best to host events at timings that would be convenient to all.</p><p>If you have any questions about my platform or would like to reach out for anything, you can reach me on Discord at LegitAdi#7004.</p><p>Thank you so much!<br>Adi ✌🏾</p></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:info@ccss.carleton.ca>info@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
