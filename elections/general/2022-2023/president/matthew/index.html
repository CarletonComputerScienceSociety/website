I’m a four-time elected CCSS executive and your current Director of Academics.</p><p>On behalf of the CCSS this year, I hosted over 20 events, organized some of our largest initiatives such as <a href=https://devday.carletoncomputerscience.ca/>Carleton Dev Day</a>, and delivered several projects to students such as <a href=http://discretemath.ca/>DiscreteMath.ca</a>. If elected, I will push the organization towards making an even greater impact on students while laying the foundations of success for the next generations of executives.</p><ol><li>A Safe Transition back to In-person 🏡<p>Having been an executive before the pandemic, I can help ensure a smooth return to on-campus operations. If the university deems it safe and regulations are lifted, we will begin the revival of our in-person services and events, while ensuring all COVID-19 guidelines and protocols are met.</p></li><li>Hybrid In-person and Online Community 💻<p>Before the pandemic, the CCSS significantly lacked ways for students on co-op work terms or off-campus to engage with our community. If elected, I vow to utilize a hybrid approach with both in-person and online activity to ensure our members not currently on campus do not feel disconnected even with a transition back to in-person.</p></li><li>A Modernized Brand Identity 🎨<p>An organization’s identity unquestionably has a direct impact on engagement. If elected, I will push for the creation of an updated identity and logo that resonates with our values and mission as an organization.</p></li><li>Expansion of Development Initiatives ⚒️<p>As the current development lead, I plan to continue the growth of our existing development initiatives, while taking on more projects that directly impact students similar to the likeness of <a href=http://discretemath.ca/>DiscreteMath.ca</a>.</p></li><li>More ways to get Involved ❤️<p>If elected, I will ensure there is a wider variety of ways to be involved with the organization. Currently, we offer term-based volunteer opportunities and elected positions with the minimum commitment of an entire year. I will push for more flexible ways of being involved for those who do not have the bandwidth to take on a high commitment position.</p></li><li>More Asynchronous Resources 💡<p>Although a significant portion of the organization’s output comes from our events, this year we’ve seen just how large the impact of online resources such as <a href=http://discretemath.ca/>DiscreteMath.ca</a> and <a href=https://courses.carletoncomputerscience.ca/>courses.carletoncomputerscience.ca</a> have had on our student body. I will be pushing for a greater focus on content similar to the projects mentioned above.</p></li><li>CCSS Office Hours 💼<p>As President, I will make myself available via Discord or our in-person lounge on a regular “office hours” type schedule as a means for our members to quickly learn about how they can get involved with our community.</p></li><li>Organizational Resilience 🏛️<p>The CCSS as an organization is very volatile to large generational handovers. This volatility directly impacts our yearly budget, relationship with the department, and the consistency of services we offer. My goal this year is to introduce and lay the groundwork for a more scalable team structure that future generations of executives can continue to use to increase our organizational resilience.</p></li></ol></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:info@ccss.carleton.ca>info@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
