I would do this by (A) looking for more beginner-friendly events, as some people are learning comp sci for the first time (B) organize game nights for some quality social time and (C) create opportunities to interact with upper years because a little guidance is always useful!</description></item><item><title>Shirley Zhan's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/shirley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/shirley/</guid><description>Hello everyone, I‚Äôm Shirley.Z and I‚Äôm running for CCSS‚Äôs first-year rep!

This is what I have planned as your first year-representative:
Create an active discussion on how to network and explain how it helps you make friends, learn knowledge fast and helps you land an internship!</description></item><item><title>Adi's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/social/adi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/social/adi/</guid><description>Hey fellow CCSS members! üëãüèæ

I‚Äôm Ryan! Some of the goals that I have are:
Continuing and expanding the sale of merchandise
As a tradition, the CCSS has been selling hoodies and other merchandise. I plan on continuing this tradition and expanding into different types of merchandise which are priced fairly. As I am starting a business entrepreneurship minor next year, I will apply my new knowledge to these ventures to further performance and sales.</description></item><item><title>Shirley's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2023-2024/academics/shirley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2023-2024/academics/shirley/</guid><description>Hello!
