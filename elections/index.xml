I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a strong focus on making CS education more accessible, extensive, and enjoyable!
As a first year rep, I&amp;rsquo;d hope to take advantage of my connections in the field to expand the current resources available to CCSS students - be it academic supports, or funds to create cool projects and plans to organize exciting events.</description></item><item><title>Alex's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/alex/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/alex/</guid><description>YOUR SUCCESS is my priority, and I mean it.

My name is Chi, and I‚Äôm excited to run for the position of First-Year Representative. I‚Äôm passionate not only about technology but also about the community that comes with it. I‚Äôm from Ottawa so if you‚Äôd like some food and restaurant suggestions, feel free to reach out and say hi! :)
As your first-year representative, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like to do for you:
1. Build a stronger community üå± Organizing weekly meetups where we can work on projects, discuss coursework, or hang out.</description></item><item><title>Jon-Luca's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/jon-luca/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/jon-luca/</guid><description>Hey! üëã My name is Jon-Luca, and I‚Äôm a first-year Computer Science student in the Cybersecurity stream.
I‚Äôll be hanging around the CCSS lounge often, so I‚Äôll be easy to find if you want to chat! üòä
I know university can be pretty overwhelming, and reaching out to a representative might feel a bit daunting. That‚Äôs why I want to make myself as approachable as possible.
üì¢ Announcements &amp;amp; Visibility üì¢ I plan to make CCSS announcements more accessible to everyone.</description></item><item><title>Maliha's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/maliha/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/maliha/</guid><description>As your first-year representative, I‚Äôll ensure the voices of all first-year students feel heard while pushing to bridge gaps between all computer science students to foster a supportive, tight-knit community here at Carleton University.
While coding is commonly seen as a solitary task, I believe true strength lies in collaboration! First-year can be a very stressful and overwhelming experience for many, so I find it very important for CCSS to host various types of events to support students coming together and connecting with others.</description></item><item><title>Muhammad's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/muhammad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/muhammad/</guid><description>The word limit is 500 I don&amp;rsquo;t need that let me keep it simple. If I was elected First-Year Representative best believe I&amp;rsquo;m going to make sure that first year student voices are heard by the board of the CCSS.
Being a first year student is crazy because more often than not we don&amp;rsquo;t really know what we&amp;rsquo;re getting ourselves into and if you are an international student like me we&amp;rsquo;re going in totally blind.</description></item><item><title>Randiv's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/randiv/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/randiv/</guid><description>If I were elected as the First-Year Representative, my top priority would be to create a strong connection between first-year students and the CCSS. To guarantee that your voices are heard, I want to ensure all communication channels to the CCSS are clear and easily accessible. Staying informed about what the Society is hosting can sometimes feel overwhelming, so I focus on creating digestible updates, through social media, email, or even short video clips.</description></item><item><title>Aires' Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2024-2025/industry/aires/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2024-2025/industry/aires/</guid><description>Hello everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m Aires!
