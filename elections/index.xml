&lt;p>Hi👋, my name is Amanjot, and I’m excited to run for &lt;strong>Director of Social&lt;/strong> for the 2025-2026 CCSS Board of Directors! As someone who loves &lt;strong>socializing and meeting new people&lt;/strong>, I believe that a strong sense of community makes the university experience more enjoyable and fulfilling. My previous &lt;strong>leadership experience&lt;/strong> has given me the skills to plan events, bring people together, and create an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cameron's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/finance/cameron/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/finance/cameron/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey everyone! I’m Cameron, and I’m running to be your Director of Finance for the 2024-2025 term.

&lt;p>Why should you vote for me? Well let me share with you what I want to accomplish as the Director of Industry Initiatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="laying-the-foundation-for-the-future">Laying the foundation for the future&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As Industry Initiatives Director, I will lay the foundation for long-term success by creating essential resources that future directors can build upon. This includes a comprehensive database to track company partnerships, a strategic playbook to guide outreach and relationship-building, and other key tools to streamline industry engagement. With these resources, we can secure stronger partnerships, increase funding for major events, and create lasting connections between students and industry leaders ensuring our society continues to thrive for years to come.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jacc's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/academics/jacc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/academics/jacc/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey everyone!

My name is Kimia and I am running in the CCSS General Election for the position of Director of Operations. I have frequently volunteered with the CCSS over the past few months and would be delighted to continue to do so and to have a greater impact and role in the society in order to further continue the efforts the CCSS puts to help represent all undergraduate computer science students. I am passionate about helping out as well as passionate about the community here at Carleton. Even if I am not elected, I wish to continue to help make the CCSS and the community an inviting and pleasant place for everyone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Landon's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/publications/landon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/publications/landon/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="new-and-improved-resources">New and Improved Resources:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In my opinion, the website has room for additional resources for:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>How to study for and where to find study material for courses&lt;/strong> that are often challenging. Often, in some of the harder second-year courses students may feel a little stuck. Instead of waiting for study session events to run on their specific course, this would be a permanent resource to help them get back on track.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Getting and preparing for internships.&lt;/strong> One of the FAQs I see all the time is “How do I get my first internship?” or “How do I prepare for an Interview?” and while we do run events specifically addressing these questions, having a dedicated page to answer your questions when you need it is nothing but a bonus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>How to get involved in open-source.&lt;/strong> Other than all the amazing benefits of open-source projects they are also an amazing spot for people to get started with development experience as there is no barrier to entry; There is no time wasted wondering what project to do; And there is something to do for any skill level.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I would take the lead on getting these resources available to students, and with the help of volunteers looking for development experience, it would be well maintained as well as knowledge transferred to future years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nandita's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/academics/nandita/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/academics/nandita/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a computer science student, I know how challenging and rewarding our courses can be. If elected as Director of Academics, I’ll work to make learning more accessible, engaging, and supportive for everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I plan to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Expand peer tutoring and study groups.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Organize talks with industry professionals and researchers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Host coding competitions, hackathons, and workshops.&lt;/li>

My name is Nguyen, and I&amp;rsquo;m a 4th-year CS student. Over the past two years, as a former teaching assistant I&amp;rsquo;ve had the privilege of helping host numerous academic events with the CCSS. My goal is simple: to provide you with the tools, resources, and support you need to succeed in your studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If elected, here&amp;rsquo;s what I plan to accomplish:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="-expanding-publicly-available-academic-resources">✏️ Expanding Publicly Available Academic Resources&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Having worked on the &lt;a href="https://questions.carletoncomputerscience.ca/evaluations/1">Carleton Computer Science Question Repository&lt;/a> (and discretemath.ca), I know how invaluable access to past midterms, assignments, and exam questions can be.

&lt;p>Hey, Carleton CS crew! 👋 I’m Nolan, a first-year CS student running for Director of Academics. New to coding, I get how tough this program is—late nights, steep curves. I want to make YOUR academic journey smoother with practical support starting Fall 2025. Inspired by CCSS events (like “Master Leetcode Challenges” and “DevOps with Ciena”), I’ll bring fresh crash courses and resources to boost our success.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Riley's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/social/riley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/social/riley/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey everyone!
My name is Riley Lutz, and I’m excited to announce my candidacy for Director of Social for the 2025-2026 academic year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know that social interaction plays a vital role in our academic success and well-being. Whether it’s collaborating on that one vexing group project, networking for our career, or just doing a bit of trolling in the CCSS lounge, staying connected with peers is part of what makes our CS journey worth experiencing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Veronica's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/president/veronica/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2025-2026/president/veronica/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello everyone! I’m Veronica, the current president and previous first-year representative, and I am running with hopes of being re-elected as CCSS president for the coming year!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I am re-elected, the following is what I would hope to accomplish during my term:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ensuring-proper-use-of-levy-funds">Ensuring Proper Use of Levy Funds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Throughout the past couple of years, we have been vouching for the establishment of a levy fee of $2.50/term for full-time students - in hopes of maintaining the operational baseline that the CCSS maintains.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Afaq's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/afaq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/afaq/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/first_year_reps/2024/afaq.png" alt="Afaq">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on all sides of education - as a computer science tutor, student, and school board trustee representing 27000 peers in Eastern Ontario. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a strong focus on making CS education more accessible, extensive, and enjoyable!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a first year rep, I&amp;rsquo;d hope to take advantage of my connections in the field to expand the current resources available to CCSS students - be it academic supports, or funds to create cool projects and plans to organize exciting events. One way I plan to do this is by strengthening connections between the CCSS and the rest of the campus as a whole, helping get our name out further while allowing us to take on bigger, better endeavours. I&amp;rsquo;d also try to connect us to external sources of funding (because who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like money) by collaborating with organizations who share similar values.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alex's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/alex/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/alex/</guid><description>&lt;p>YOUR SUCCESS is my priority, and I mean it.

&lt;p>Hello everyone! My name is Chi, and I’m excited to run for the position of First-Year Representative. I’m passionate not only about technology but also about the community that comes with it. I’m from Ottawa so if you’d like some food and restaurant suggestions, feel free to reach out and say hi! :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hey! 👋 My name is Jon-Luca, and I’m a first-year Computer Science student in the Cybersecurity stream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll be hanging around the CCSS lounge often, so I’ll be easy to find if you want to chat! 😊&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know university can be pretty overwhelming, and reaching out to a representative might feel a bit daunting. That’s why I want to make myself as approachable as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="-announcements--visibility-">📢 Announcements &amp;amp; Visibility 📢&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>As your first-year representative, I’ll ensure the voices of all first-year students feel heard while pushing to bridge gaps between all computer science students to foster a supportive, tight-knit community here at Carleton University.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While coding is commonly seen as a solitary task, I believe true strength lies in collaboration! First-year can be a very stressful and overwhelming experience for many, so I find it very important for CCSS to host various types of events to support students coming together and connecting with others. By organising a diverse range of events–from casual meetups to collaborative workshops–we can ensure that students can not only find support through their peers, but feel as though they belong amongst a community.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Muhammad's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/muhammad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/muhammad/</guid><description>&lt;p>The word limit is 500 I don&amp;rsquo;t need that let me keep it simple. If I was elected First-Year Representative best believe I&amp;rsquo;m going to make sure that first year student voices are heard by the board of the CCSS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being a first year student is crazy because more often than not we don&amp;rsquo;t really know what we&amp;rsquo;re getting ourselves into and if you are an international student like me we&amp;rsquo;re going in totally blind. As your rep I&amp;rsquo;m going to make sure that we know exactly what we&amp;rsquo;re doing, that&amp;rsquo;s important. On top of that I&amp;rsquo;m going to make sure that we get our recognition and have our impact on the board and the decisions that are made. I use the plural tense in these examples because this position will not be my position it will be OUR position.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Randiv's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/randiv/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2024-2025/randiv/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ccss.carleton.ca/images/first_year_reps/2024/randiv.PNG" alt="Randiv">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I were elected as the First-Year Representative, my top priority would be to create a strong connection between first-year students and the CCSS. To guarantee that your voices are heard, I want to ensure all communication channels to the CCSS are clear and easily accessible. Staying informed about what the Society is hosting can sometimes feel overwhelming, so I focus on creating digestible updates, through social media, email, or even short video clips. By actively collecting your feedback, I can ensure that CCSS is doing what you want! Whether you have ideas for events, suggestions for improvement, or concerns that need addressing, there will always be open lines of communication through drop-in sessions and constructive feedback forms where you can share your thoughts directly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Aires' Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2024-2025/industry/aires/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2024-2025/industry/aires/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m Aires! As your first-year representative, I have ran several events related to networking, and I look forward to boost my impact as the Director of Industry initiatives.

&lt;p>This year, I organized the first resume roast at the beginning of the year where I invited a graduate student with FANG experience as well as two other reviewers with startup experience to come in as resume reviewers.

My name is Ben, and I’m currently in 2nd year. Having already had 1 year of experience as your Director of Academics, I believe that I can help contribute to your academic success. Computer science is a hard program to get through, but I want to make YOUR life easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some ideas I have to meet that goal:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Course-specific study groups&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a lot of courses that could benefit from organized group study, and over the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve helped run multiple study groups. Sometimes it really helps to have a place where everyone can come together and share their ideas in preparation for a test/assignment. This is something I plan on continuing throughout the academic year, and I would be open to organizing one as soon as there is enough demand.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Camerons' Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2024-2025/finance/cameron/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2024-2025/finance/cameron/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey everyone!

As I am starting a business entrepreneurship minor next year, I will apply my new knowledge to these ventures to further performance and sales.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shirley's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2023-2024/academics/shirley/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2023-2024/academics/shirley/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello! My name is Shirley and I’ve had 2 years of experience on the CCSS council. I’ve conducted various events and hosted dozens of initiatives while being a representative. Once elected, I will organize a variety of initiatives to help with academic success, create opportunities, and introduce new topics within the tech industry! The details for the initiatives are below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Study Sessions 📚&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If elected, I will make sure to conduct study sessions on difficult courses to help prepare for midterms and exams. These study sessions will be assisted with resources such as the discrete math website.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Tech Workshops 🖥️&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Victor's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2023-2024/president/victor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2023-2024/president/victor/</guid><description>&lt;p>As the Carleton Computer Science Society President, my platform will focus on three key areas: community building, education, and professional development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🏡 Community Building:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or background.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Promote collaboration between different Computer Science clubs and organizations to serve the student community better.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Making myself available via Discord and our lounge to ask questions about either school, professional life and how they can get involved with our community&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>📚 Education:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ari Rubin's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/ari/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/ari/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi everybody, I’m Ari and I’m running for first year representative for the CCSS. As part of running my high school’s coding club I have experience teaching the ins and outs of object based programming and the skills for making cool projects. If I’m elected I hope to create more follow along workshops that would run people through making basic to advanced programs in an easy to understand way (I know I always get lost). I also want to provide a better platform for helping with classes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sahil Gagvani 's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/sahil/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/sahil/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey! My name is Sahil, and I’m running to be your First-Year rep at the CCSS!
Having oranised and participated in various hackathons, seminars and workshops, I’ve
concluded that the best way to grow as a professional in today’s tech scene is by developing
soft skills; something that a classroom environment often fails to deliver.
As a means to collectively work on our existing technical and interpersonal skills, I have
planned various activities if I’m elected as your first year rep. Some of them are:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rabten Tsering's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/rabten/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/rabten/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey fellow first years, my name is Rabten, Ragna on discord. As a first-year rep, I’m looking to connect with other first years and create a friendly environment in the discord and soon on campus. Schooling during a global pandemic leaves much to be desired, but I hope to make the best out of our situation and create an online and offline community that we can all thrive in! I would do this by (A) looking for more beginner-friendly events, as some people are learning comp sci for the first time (B) organize game nights for some quality social time and (C) create opportunities to interact with upper years because a little guidance is always useful!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shirley Zhan's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/shirley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/shirley/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello everyone, I’m Shirley.Z and I’m running for CCSS’s first-year rep! I’m going to make this really short since I know everyone’s really busy. I have a lot of experience working in leadership positions in various clubs and councils(can vouch as someone who’s joined 9+ extracurriculars overall in high school) so I think I’ll fit this position perfectly. On top of that, I also really love drawing and if I’m voted, I’ll be sure to bring some artistic and creative ideas to CCSS events. And on top of all that, I’m 100% a cat person. If all that interests you, vote for me!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thushen Mohanarajah's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/thushen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/fyr/2021-2021/thushen/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s make this short and sweet. I&amp;rsquo;m Thushen! In my past experiences working at RBC as an Innovation Developer, attending hackathons and running the Computer Science Club at my high school. I learned pure coding skills aren&amp;rsquo;t enough. Networking is one of the most important skills to create opportunities, to learn and grow as an individual. This is what I have planned as your first year-representative:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Create an active discussion on how to network and explain how it helps you make friends, learn knowledge fast and helps you land an internship!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Host more networking events!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Host beginner workshops in many tech-related categories such as Git, Socket.io and Android development.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Move more CCSS events to &lt;a href="https://www.gather.town/?utm_term=gather%20town&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Branded%20Search_Gather%20Town&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=search&amp;amp;utm_content=499147839023&amp;amp;hsa_acc=5772092952&amp;amp;hsa_cam=12358653067&amp;amp;hsa_grp=121764253590&amp;amp;hsa_ad=499147839023&amp;amp;hsa_src=g&amp;amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-981544684057&amp;amp;hsa_kw=gather%20town&amp;amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwtMCKBhDAARIsAG-2Eu9fmw4ThqtQhmJAl8YNSYalyedtwlDWCiwCB0bh_2XGeVOGq2YXU-AaAkWAEALw_wcB">Gather Town&lt;/a> to make a more interactive experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make some CCSS events in-person in the winter term as long as the School of Computer Science deems it is safe.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What is Gather Town? Gather Town is a web-conferencing software like Zoom, but with the added component of seeing the virtual “room” you and others are occupying, and with the ability to move around and interact with other participants based on your locations in the room, just like real life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adi's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/social/adi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/social/adi/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey fellow CCSS members! 👋🏾&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m Aaditya Chopra (or you could just call me Adi) and I’m running to be your Director of Social for this year’s board of directors!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m someone who’s really passionate about getting involved with the student body, as well as event planning and having some fun, while also connecting with other people! As such, I would love to bring that passion to the board of directors this year as we transition from this weird online/in-person phase.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amelie's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/academics/amelie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/academics/amelie/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello world! My name is Amelie Haefele and I&amp;rsquo;m going into my third year here at Carleton while currently living on residence. I promise to encourage the academic opportunities and learning of all students in Carleton’s Computer Science Society and any others who wish to join. With the move to online many, including myself have found it much harder to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
To combat this I plan to create online and in person events so everyone can choose which medium they prefer. 
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
To do this I will plan to have in person events(rules permitting) and livestream it using zoom and/or discord. Along with connecting chat to the speaker so they are able to answer questions and interact with students.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
To start this off I plan to create an in person meet and greet/study session on campus for those interested.
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So stay tuned for timing and more information. I hope to meet and interact with you all soon!
Thank you so much for reading,&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fahim's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/finance/fahim/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/finance/fahim/</guid><description>&lt;p>I would like to run for the Director of Finance because it&amp;rsquo;s a great opportunity for me to improve my current skills and give back to the computer science community. Ever since I came to Carleton I wanted to be as involved in the community as I could. Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;m well qualified for this position given my past jobs and academic courses. I’m currently doing a minor in business and have taken multiple business courses in high school. This is a great opportunity for me to not only improve the finance department but to meet new people and form connections as well. If I am elected, I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure to improve the current budget or create a new one if the need be. I’ll make sure that it benefits and accounts for all department&amp;rsquo;s and individuals’ needs. Furthermore, I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure to request financial aid from the administration and other organizations to make sure all our planned events run smoothly and according to plan.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Forest's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/vice-president/forest/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/vice-president/forest/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Forest!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a 4th year student in the Game Development stream. I&amp;rsquo;m also Carleton&amp;rsquo;s Github Campus Expert; one of fewer than 10 in Canada. I&amp;rsquo;m a big advocate of open source development, primarily as a core developer of Veloren. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m a contributor to the Rust language, where I focus on the community as a lead of the CTCFT team and the gamedev working group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the Vice President of the Carleton Computer Science Society, I would focus on empowering the other members of the board. As a previous exec of several years, I want to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned with the future leaders of computer science at Carleton. In my opinion, the society thrives most when board members help one another, and I want to play that support role for the team.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Matthew's Platform</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/president/matthew/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/elections/general/2022-2023/president/matthew/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey There, I&amp;rsquo;m Matthew!

My name is Victor Li, and this will be my second year running for the Director of Finance. I have a lot of experience doing personal and club finances from high school and CCSS. Some of my goals for this year are to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
Continue selling hoodies and other merchandise like t-shirts, pins, and laptop stickers using new designs and possibly use designs from the 2021-2022 Hoodie contest with artists' approval.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
Document our finances into two accounts instead of one. I will record the Lounge's earnings and expenses separately from the society's academic and social events. We can use our earnings from the Lounge to vote on future equipment or more significant scale events during our general meeting.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
Move away from spreadsheets and towards professional accounting software to improve the ease of maintaining society accounts and bookkeeping.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
Promote the importance of the role of the treasurer while being transparent and accountable with our finances.
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The challenge of managing budgets and money can be complicated. Still, using the knowledge I&amp;rsquo;ve gained through past administrative experience, I am willing to take on this challenge and make our finances as straightforward and uncomplicated as possible.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
