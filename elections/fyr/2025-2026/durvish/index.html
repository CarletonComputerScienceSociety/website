Starting university can feel overwhelming, from navigating deadlines to understanding co-op and internships, and I want to be the <em>bridge</em> that ensures none of us face these challenges alone.</p><p>One of my first initiatives will be to organize an <strong>open Q&amp;A with upper-year students</strong> who’ve successfully gone through what we’re starting. These sessions will let us ask candid questions about academics, co-op applications, career building, and even personal well-being. Think of it as <em>“Office Hours: Unfiltered”</em>, real stories, real advice.</p><p><em>Also, because I consider all of us to be one big family</em>, at no point do I think I’m in charge! <em>To have your voice heard</em>, I’ll <strong>set up polls for voting, so you choose what happens and which events are held!</strong> Additionally, I’ll keep an <strong>open suggestion form</strong> for ideas you’d like done, and if possible, I’ll make them happen.</p><p>Furthermore, since community is at the heart of my platform, I want us to feel connected as people, beyond academics. I’d work with CCSS to create <strong>casual social events</strong>, game nights, coding challenges, and open drop-ins where friendships are built (because our first year should be full of memories). University is as much about <em>relationships</em> as it is about lectures, and I want to ensure every student finds their place here.</p><p>Another key goal is to make the <strong>co-op and internship process less intimidating</strong>. I’ll connect us with workshops, alumni, and resources on résumés, interviews, and finding roles that match our interests. I also want to spotlight opportunities like <strong>hackathons, coding competitions, and research projects</strong>, places to apply what we learn in class to real-world problems while building our skills and networks.</p><p>In short, if elected, I’ll make our first year not just <em>manageable</em> but <em>meaningful</em>. I’ll be an advocate for clarity in academics and career pathways, a voice for our concerns, and a leader who fosters community and inclusivity.</p><p>Together, we can make this year, one where we not only learn computer science but also discover how strong we can be as a community ❤ ️.</p><hr><noscript><img src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/pixel.gif></noscript><script defer src=https://shynet-mpb4.onrender.com/ingress/7b07c3d5-c87b-4c27-a3c0-6d7c060d4d17/script.js></script></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:bod@ccss.carleton.ca>bod@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
