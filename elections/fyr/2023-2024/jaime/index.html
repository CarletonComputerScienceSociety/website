My name is Jaime Sexton, and I’m a first year student in Computer Science (if you’re reading this, you probably are too). I’ve been interested in computer science for many years, and I would like to become more involved with the CCSS by being a first year representative!</p><h3 id=-representing-all-first-years-in-carleton-computer-science->💻 Representing all first years in Carleton Computer Science 💻</h3><p>Representing first years is a very important task that I would take seriously. As the voice of the first years in computer science, I would make sure to bring up issues you may have at CCSS meetings, and listen to every complaint.</p><p>Do you want to see an event happen? Contact me! All ideas are worth listening to, and I will do my best to make it happen.</p><p>Do you have issues you need solved? Let me know! Together we can figure out a solution.</p><h3 id=-study-sessions->📚 Study Sessions 📚</h3><p>The switch from high school to university can be hard, especially if classes are tough. I plan to have regular study sessions for first year comp courses, which everyone can come to. These sessions would help everyone:</p><ul><li>If you’re struggling, you can receive help from others</li><li>If you already have a decent understanding of comp courses, helping other students will get you involved in the community and solidify your understanding even more.</li></ul><h3 id=-events-to-make-learning-fun->✏️ Events to make learning fun! ✏️</h3><p>I will also host events intended to prevent cramming right before exams, by giving people incentive to do work regularly. These events will include</p><ul><li>Kahoot</li><li>Puzzles based on relevant classwork</li><li>Games to get you working!</li></ul><h3 id=-fun-in-the-community->🎉 Fun in the community 🎉</h3><p>It’s always fun to be involved in your community, but sometimes it can be hard or intimidating to talk to people. I would host events intended to bring the community together, and make it easier for students to get to know each other. These would also help you get to know the upperclassmen, and maybe even some professors. These could include:</p><ul><li>Team building activities</li><li>Events that let you meet upper year students and professors</li><li>Group games</li><li>Friendly competitions!</li></ul><p>I would also host events that are more chill, like movie nights, game nights (online and offline), and activities for you to hang out with your friends.</p><p>Don’t hesitate to contact me!
