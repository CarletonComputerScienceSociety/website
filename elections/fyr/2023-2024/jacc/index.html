My name is Aditya but my friends call me Jacc. I’m an international student from India and while I’m not currently in a stream, I’m considering minors in Law and Physics. You may know me as the owner of the “Carleton Class of ‘27” discord server. I have been running informational and social events for incoming first-year students over the summer. I have also been volunteering with the CCSS for the last few months to create a new resources section of the CCSS website.</p><p>As a first-year student representative here is what I can do for you.</p><h3 id=-student-led-presentations->🧑‍🎓 Student-led presentations 🧑‍🎓</h3><p>As first-year students, I’m sure you have questions about Carleton, and how future years of schooling will look. I plan to have some upper-year CS students hold presentations on a variety of topics such as co-op experience, internship experiences, and more. These events would be a great way to express concerns for the future and learn necessary skills for the future.</p><h3 id=-cs-opportunities-at-carleton->💻 CS opportunities at Carleton 💻</h3><p>I plan to promote opportunities that will help students gain relevant experience through programs such as the DSRI, I-CUREUS and SaPP. I also wish to bring in people to share their experiences with these programs and advise those who wish to pursue these programs themselves.</p><h3 id=-more-volunteer-opportunities-for-students->📋 More volunteer opportunities for students 📋</h3><p>I will create more volunteer opportunities and streamline the process of getting involved with the CCSS to allow more people to get CCR credit.</p><h3 id=-collaborating-with-other-clubs-for-events->🤝 Collaborating with other clubs for events 🤝</h3><p>I will plan collaborative events with other Carleton clubs to add diversity to the events that the CCSS runs. This will create more volunteer opportunities for students. Lastly, it is a great way to meet people outside your social circle.</p><h3 id=-interactive-social-events->🎉 Interactive social events 🎉</h3><p>I will host a variety of social events where students can socialize with each other, as well as personally talk to me about any suggestions or concerns they have in a casual setting.</p><p>In addition to these plans, I will also focus on:</p><p>Organizing group study sessions and creating more academic resources. 📚</p><p>Compiling a library of peer-reviewed online resources for self-learning. 🧠</p><p>Creating a fun learning environment for all computer science students! 💪</p><p>Feel free to reach out to me for more information! :)</p><p>Discord: jaccolantern</p><p>Instagram: jacc04</p></body><div class=footer><div class=footer-text><p><b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b><br>4135 Herzberg Laboratories<br>1125 Colonel By Drive,<br>Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6<br><br>email: <a href=mailto:info@ccss.carleton.ca>info@ccss.carleton.ca</a></p></div><div class=footer-socials><a href=http://discord.carletoncomputersciencesociety.ca><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a>
