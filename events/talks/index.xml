For natural processes, this could be thought of as the biochemical processes dictated by genes or other natural forces. For human-engineered processes, such algorithms represent either memetic thought within a culture or the physical limitations and requirements for human use. This research has examined inferring the algorithms used by such processes from data observed over time. For example, taking a sequence of photos of a plant as it grows can be used to infer the algorithm used by the plant to grow.</description></item><item><title>Your First Web Service</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-09-15-your-first-web-service/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-09-15-your-first-web-service/</guid><description>Description &amp;ldquo;Your First Web Service&amp;rdquo; is a beginner friendly workshop that will teach you how to build your first web service using Python and Fast API.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Talks</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-09-13-lightning-talks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2021-2022/2021-09-13-lightning-talks/</guid><description>Description Get ready for our first virtual tech talks of the fall semester!
